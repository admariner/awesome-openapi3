  # ⨁ gnostic


  This repository contains a Go command line tool which converts JSON and YAML

  [OpenAPI](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) descriptions to and

  from equivalent Protocol Buffer representations.


  [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) provide a

  language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing

  structured data. **gnostic**'s Protocol Buffer models for the OpenAPI

  Specification can be used to generate code that includes data structures with

  explicit fields for the elements of an OpenAPI description. This makes it

  possible for developers to work with OpenAPI descriptions in type-safe ways,

  which is particularly useful in strongly-typed languages like Go and

  [Dart](https://dart.dev/).


  **gnostic** reads OpenAPI descriptions into these generated data structures,

  reports errors, resolves internal dependencies, and writes the results in a

  binary form that can be used in any language that is supported by the Protocol

  Buffer tools. A plugin interface simplifies integration with API tools written

  in a variety of different languages, and when necessary, Protocol Buffer

  OpenAPI descriptions can be reexported as JSON or YAML.


  **gnostic** compilation code and OpenAPI Protocol Buffer models are

  automatically generated from an

  [OpenAPI JSON
  Schema](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/schemas/v2.0/schema.json).

  Source code for the generator is in the [generate-gnostic](generate-gnostic)

  directory.


  ## Disclaimer


  Feedback and contributions are welcome! Until there is a 1.0 release, please

  consider this prerelease software and work in progress. To ensure stable

  builds, we request that dependent projects always refer to tagged releases of

  **gnostic**.


  ## Requirements


  **gnostic** can be run in any environment that supports
  [Go](http://golang.org)

  and the

  [Protocol Buffer Compiler](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf).


  ## Installation and Getting Started


  The following instructions are for installing **gnostic** using

  [Go modules](https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules), supported by Go 1.11

  and later.


  1.  Get this package by downloading it with `git clone`.

          git clone https://github.com/googleapis/gnostic
          cd gnostic

  2.  Verify that you have a local installation of `protoc`. You can get protoc
      [here](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf).

  3.  Build **gnostic** with `make`. This uses
      [go generate](https://blog.golang.org/generate) to build support code
      including code generated by `protoc` and the Go protoc plugin, which is
      automatically downloaded from
      [github.com/golang/protobuf](https://github.com/golang/protobuf) by the
      [COMPILE-PROTOS.sh](COMPILE-PROTOS.sh) script. This also builds all plugins
      and associated tools in this repo.

  4.  Verify **gnostic** with `make test`. These tests are run by **gnostic**'s
      continuous integration, so you should expect them to pass for all release
      versions.

  5.  Run **gnostic**. This sample invocation creates a file in the current
      directory named `petstore.pb` that contains a binary Protocol Buffer
      description of a sample API.

              gnostic --pb-out=. examples/v2.0/json/petstore.json

  6.  You can also compile files that you specify with a URL. Here's another way
      to compile the previous example. This time we're creating `petstore.text`,
      which contains a textual representation of the Protocol Buffer description.
      This is mainly for use in testing and debugging.

              gnostic --text-out=petstore.text https://raw.githubusercontent.com/googleapis/gnostic/master/examples/v2.0/json/petstore.json

  7.  For a sample application, see apps/report. This reads a binary Protocol
      Buffer encoding created by **gnostic**.

          go install ./apps/report ## automatically installed by the top-level Makefile
          report petstore.pb

  8.  **gnostic** also supports plugins. **gnostic**'s plugin interface is
      modeled on `protoc`'s
      [plugin.proto](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/master/src/google/protobuf/compiler/plugin.proto)
      and is described in [plugins/plugin.proto](plugins/plugin.proto). Several
      plugins are implemented in the `plugins` directory. Others, like
      [gnostic-grpc](https://github.com/googleapis/gnostic-grpc) and
      [gnostic-go-generator](https://github.com/googleapis/gnostic-go-generator),
      are published in their own repositories. One such plugin is
      [gnostic-vocabulary](plugins/gnostic-vocabulary), which produces a summary
      of the word usage in an APIs interfaces. You can run `gnostic-vocabulary`
      with the following:

              gnostic examples/v2.0/json/petstore.json --vocabulary_out=.

      This will produce files named `vocabulary.pb` and `vocabulary.json` in
      `examples/v2.0/json`. For the format of `vocabulary.pb`, see
      [metrics/vocabulary.proto](metrics/vocabulary.proto).

  9.  [Optional] A large part of **gnostic** is automatically-generated by the
      [generate-gnostic](generate-gnostic) tool. This uses JSON schemas to
      generate Protocol Buffer language files that describe supported API
      specification formats and Go-language files of code that will read JSON or
      YAML API descriptions into the generated protocol buffer models.
      Pre-generated versions of these files are checked into the
      [openapiv2](openapiv2), [openapiv3](openapiv3), and [discovery](discovery)
      directories. You can regenerate this code with the following:

          go install ./generate-gnostic
          generate-gnostic --v2
          generate-gnostic --v3
          generate-gnostic --discovery

  A python client for [Swagger](https://helloreverb.com/developers/swagger)
  enabled REST API. It wouldn't be easier to

  try Swagger REST API by [Swagger-UI](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-ui).
  However, when it's time to **unittest**

  your API, the first option you find would be
  [Swagger-codegen](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-codegen), but the better
  option is us.


  This project is developed after
  [swagger-py](https://github.com/digium/swagger-py), which is a nicely
  implemented one, and inspired many aspects of this project. Another project is
  [flex](https://github.com/pipermerriam/flex), which focuses on parameter
  validation, try it if you can handle other parts by yourselves. For other
  projects related to Swagger tools in python, check
  [here](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec#python).


  **pyswagger** is much easier to use (compared to swagger-codegen, you don't
  need to prepare a scala environment) and tries hard to **fully supports**
  [Swagger Spec](https://helloreverb.com/developers/swagger) in all aspects.

  ## Quick Start


  Before running this script, please make sure
  [requests](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests) is installed on your
  environment.


  ```python

  from pyswagger import App, Security

  from pyswagger.contrib.client.requests import Client

  from pyswagger.utils import jp_compose


  # load Swagger resource file into App object

  app = App._create_('http://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json')


  auth = Security(app)

  auth.update_with('api_key', '12312312312312312313q') # api key

  auth.update_with('petstore_auth', '12334546556521123fsfss') # oauth2


  # init swagger client

  client = Client(auth)


  # a dict is enough for representing a Model in Swagger

  pet_Tom=dict(id=1, name='Tom', photoUrls=['http://test']) 

  # a request to create a new pet

  client.request(app.op['addPet'](body=pet_Tom))


  # - access an Operation object via App.op when operationId is defined

  # - a request to get the pet back

  req, resp = app.op['getPetById'](petId=1)

  # prefer json as response

  req.produce('application/json')

  pet = client.request((req, resp)).data

  assert pet.id == 1

  assert pet.name == 'Tom'


  # new ways to get Operation object corresponding to 'getPetById'.

  # 'jp_compose' stands for JSON-Pointer composition

  req, resp = app.resolve(jp_compose('/pet/{petId}',
  base='#/paths')).get(petId=1)

  req.produce('application/json')

  pet = client.request((req, resp)).data

  assert pet.id == 1

  ```


  ---------


  ## Installation

  We support pip installtion.

  ```bash

  pip install pyswagger

  ```


  Additional dependencies must be prepared before firing a request. If you are
  going to access a remote/local web server, you must install
  [requests](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests) first.

  ```bash

  pip install requests

  ```


  If you want to test a local tornado server, please make sure tornado is ready
  on your environment

  ``` bash

  pip install tornado

  ```


  We also provide native client for flask app, but to use it, flask is also
  required

  ``` bash

  pip install flask

  ```

  ## Releases

  **Important:** all the 2.x releases are deployed to npm and can be used via
  jsdeliver:

  - particular release, e.g. `v2.0.0-alpha.15`:
  https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/redoc@2.0.0-alpha.17/bundles/redoc.standalone.js

  - `next` release:
  https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/redoc@next/bundles/redoc.standalone.js


  Additionally, all the 1.x releases are hosted on our GitHub Pages-based CDN
  **(deprecated)**:

  - particular release, e.g. `v1.2.0`:
  https://rebilly.github.io/ReDoc/releases/v1.2.0/redoc.min.js

  - `v1.x.x` release:
  https://rebilly.github.io/ReDoc/releases/v1.x.x/redoc.min.js

  - `latest` release:
  https://rebilly.github.io/ReDoc/releases/latest/redoc.min.js - it will point
  to latest 1.x.x release since 2.x releases are not hosted on this CDN but on
  unpkg.

  **IMPORTANT NOTE:** if you work with untrusted user spec, use `untrusted-spec`
  [option](#redoc-options-object) to prevent XSS security risks.


  ### 1. Install ReDoc (skip this step for CDN)

  Install using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com):

      yarn add redoc

  or using [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm):

      npm install redoc --save

  ### 2. Reference redoc script in HTML

  For **CDN**:

  ```html

  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/redoc/bundles/redoc.standalone.js">
  </script>

  ```


  For npm:

  ```html

  <script src="node_modules/redoc/bundles/redoc.standalone.js"> </script>

  ```


  ### 3. Add `<redoc>` element to your page

  ```html

  <redoc spec-url="url/to/your/spec"></redoc>

  ```


  ### 4. Enjoy :smile:



  ## Usage as a React component


  Install peer dependencies required by ReDoc if you don't have them installed
  already:

      npm i react react-dom mobx@^4.2.0 styled-components

  Import `RedocStandalone` component from 'redoc' module:


  ```js

  import { RedocStandalone } from 'redoc';

  ```


  and use it somewhere in your component:


  ```js

  <RedocStandalone specUrl="url/to/your/spec"/>

  ```


  or


  ```js

  <RedocStandalone spec={/* spec as an object */}/>

  ```


  Also you can pass options:


  ```js

  <RedocStandalone
    specUrl="http://rebilly.github.io/RebillyAPI/openapi.json"
    options={{
      nativeScrollbars: true,
      theme: { colors: { primary: { main: '#dd5522' } } },
    }}
  />

  ```


  Here are detailed [options docs](#redoc-options-object).


  You can also specify `onLoaded` callback which will be called each time Redoc
  has been fully rendered or when error occurs (with an error as the first
  argument). *NOTE*: It may be called multiply times if you change component
  properties


  ```js

  <RedocStandalone
    specUrl="http://rebilly.github.io/RebillyAPI/openapi.json"
    onLoaded={error => {
      if (!error) {
        console.log('Yay!');
      }
    }}
  />

  ```


  [**IE11 Support Notes**](docs/usage-with-ie11.md)


  ## The Docker way


  ReDoc is available as pre-built Docker image in official [Docker Hub
  repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/redocly/redoc/). You may simply pull &
  run it:

      docker pull redocly/redoc
      docker run -p 8080:80 redocly/redoc

  Also you may rewrite some predefined environment variables defined in
  [Dockerfile](./config/docker/Dockerfile). By default ReDoc starts with demo
  Petstore spec located at `http://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json`, but you
  may change this URL using environment variable `SPEC_URL`:

      docker run -p 8080:80 -e SPEC_URL=https://api.example.com/openapi.json redocly/redoc

  ## ReDoc CLI


  [See here](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc/blob/master/cli/README.md)


  ## Configuration


  ### Security Definition location

  You can inject Security Definitions widget into any place of your
  specification `description`. Check out details
  [here](docs/security-definitions-injection.md).


  ### Swagger vendor extensions

  ReDoc makes use of the following [vendor
  extensions](https://swagger.io/specification/#specificationExtensions):

  * [`x-logo`](docs/redoc-vendor-extensions.md#x-logo) - is used to specify API
  logo

  * [`x-traitTag`](docs/redoc-vendor-extensions.md#x-traitTag) - useful for
  handling out common things like Pagination, Rate-Limits, etc

  * [`x-code-samples`](docs/redoc-vendor-extensions.md#x-code-samples) - specify
  operation code samples

  * [`x-examples`](docs/redoc-vendor-extensions.md#x-examples) - specify JSON
  example for requests

  * [`x-nullable`](docs/redoc-vendor-extensions.md#nullable) - mark schema param
  as a nullable

  * [`x-displayName`](docs/redoc-vendor-extensions.md#x-displayname) - specify
  human-friendly names for the menu categories

  * [`x-tagGroups`](docs/redoc-vendor-extensions.md#x-tagGroups) - group tags by
  categories in the side menu

  * [`x-servers`](docs/redoc-vendor-extensions.md#x-servers) - ability to
  specify different servers for API (backported from OpenAPI 3.0)

  *
  [`x-ignoredHeaderParameters`](docs/redoc-vendor-extensions.md#x-ignoredHeaderParameters)
  - ability to specify header parameter names to ignore


  ### `<redoc>` options object

  You can use all of the following options with standalone version on <redoc>
  tag by kebab-casing them, e.g. `scrollYOffset` becomes `scroll-y-offset` and
  `expandResponses` becomes `expand-responses`.


  * `untrustedSpec` - if set, the spec is considered untrusted and all
  HTML/markdown is sanitized to prevent XSS. **Disabled by default** for
  performance reasons. **Enable this option if you work with untrusted user
  data!**

  * `scrollYOffset` - If set, specifies a vertical scroll-offset. This is often
  useful when there are fixed positioned elements at the top of the page, such
  as navbars, headers etc;

  `scrollYOffset` can be specified in various ways:
    * **number**: A fixed number of pixels to be used as offset;
    * **selector**: selector of the element to be used for specifying the offset. The distance from the top of the page to the element's bottom will be used as offset;
    * **function**: A getter function. Must return a number representing the offset (in pixels);
  * `suppressWarnings` - if set, warnings are not rendered at the top of
  documentation (they still are logged to the console).

  * `lazyRendering` - _Not implemented yet_ ~~if set, enables lazy rendering
  mode in ReDoc. This mode is useful for APIs with big number of operations
  (e.g. > 50). In this mode ReDoc shows initial screen ASAP and then renders the
  rest operations asynchronously while showing progress bar on the top. Check
  out the [demo](\\redocly.github.io/redoc) for the example.~~

  * `hideHostname` - if set, the protocol and hostname is not shown in the
  operation definition.

  * `expandResponses` - specify which responses to expand by default by response
  codes. Values should be passed as comma-separated list without spaces e.g.
  `expandResponses="200,201"`. Special value `"all"` expands all responses by
  default. Be careful: this option can slow-down documentation rendering time.

  * `requiredPropsFirst` - show required properties first ordered in the same
  order as in `required` array.

  * `sortPropsAlphabetically` - sort properties alphabetically

  * `showExtensions` - show vendor extensions ("x-" fields). Extensions used by
  ReDoc are ignored. Can be boolean or an array of `string` with names of
  extensions to display

  * `noAutoAuth` - do not inject Authentication section automatically

  * `pathInMiddlePanel` - show path link and HTTP verb in the middle panel
  instead of the right one

  * `hideLoading` - do not show loading animation. Useful for small docs

  * `nativeScrollbars` - use native scrollbar for sidemenu instead of
  perfect-scroll (scrolling performance optimization for big specs)

  * `hideDownloadButton` - do not show "Download" spec button. **THIS DOESN'T
  MAKE YOUR SPEC PRIVATE**, it just hides the button.

  * `disableSearch` - disable search indexing and search box

  * `onlyRequiredInSamples` - shows only required fields in request samples.

  * `theme` - ReDoc theme. Not documented yet. For details check source code:
  [theme.ts](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc/blob/master/src/theme.ts)


  ## Advanced usage of standalone version

  Instead of adding `spec-url` attribute to the `<redoc>` element you can
  initialize ReDoc via globally exposed `Redoc` object:

  ```js

  Redoc.init(specOrSpecUrl, options, element, callback?)

  ```


  - `specOrSpecUrl` is either JSON object with specification or an URL to the
  spec in `JSON` or `YAML` format

  - `options` [options object](#redoc-options-object)

  - `element` DOM element to put ReDoc into

  - `callback` (optional) - callback to be called after Redoc has been fully
  rendered. It is also called also on errors with error as the first argument


  ```js

  Redoc.init('http://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json', {
    scrollYOffset: 50
  }, document.getElementById('redoc-container'))

  ```

  ### News


  * Version 4.0 changes:
    * Now uses Promises not callbacks
    * Option to output html directly, and to ReSpec format
    * Unified JavaScript and Node.js code-samples, PHP added
    * `restrictions` column (`readOnly`/`writeOnly`) added to schema templates
    * Numerous bug fixes
  * As of v3.0.0 Widdershins no longer expands the definition of OpenAPI body
  parameters / requestBodies by default, unless they have an inline schema. You
  can restore the old behaviour by using the `--expandBody` option.

  * You may limit the depth of schema examples using the `--maxDepth` option.
  The default is 10.

  * To omit schemas entirely, please copy and customise the `main.dot` template.

  * As of v3.1.0 Widdershins includes a generated `Authorization` header in
  OpenAPI code samples. If you wish to omit this, see
  [here](/templates/openapi3/README.md).


  ### To install


  * Clone the git repository, and `npm i` to install dependencies, or

  * `npm install [-g] widdershins` to install globally


  ### Getting started


  Widdershins is generally used as a stage in an API documentation pipeline. The
  pipeline begins with an API definition in OpenAPI 3.x, OpenAPI 2.0 (fka
  Swagger), API Blueprint, AsyncAPI or Semoasa format. Widdershins converts this
  description into markdown suitable for use by a **renderer**, such as
  [Slate](https://github.com/lord/slate),
  [Shins](https://github.com/mermade/shins) or html suitable for use with
  [ReSpec](https://github.com/w3c/respec).


  If you need to create your input API definition, [this list of available
  editors](https://apis.guru/awesome-openapi3/category.html#editors) may be
  useful.


  More in-depth documentation is [available
  here](https://mermade.github.io/widdershins).


  ### Examples


  ```

  node widdershins --search false --language_tabs 'ruby:Ruby' 'python:Python'
  --summary defs/petstore3.json -o petstore3.md

  ```


  ### Options


  | CLI parameter name | JavaScript parameter name | Type | Default value |
  Description |

  | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

  | --customApiKeyValue | options.customApiKeyValue | `string` | `ApiKey` | Set
  a custom API key value to use as the API key in generated code examples. |

  | --expandBody | options.expandBody | `boolean` | `false` | If a method's
  requestBody parameter refers to a schema by reference (not with a inline
  schema), by default, Widdershins shows only a reference to this parameter. Set
  this option to true to expand the schema and show all properties in the
  request body. |

  | --headings | options.headings | `integer` | 2 | Set the value of the
  `headingLevel` parameter in the header so Shins knows how many heading levels
  to show in the table of contents. Currently supported only by Shins, not by
  Slate, which lacks this feature. |

  | --omitBody | options.omitBody | `boolean` | `false` | By default,
  Widdershins includes the body parameter as a row in the parameters table
  before the rows that represent the fields in the body. Set this parameter to
  omit that body parameter row. |

  | --omitHeader | options.omitHeader | `boolean` | `false` | Omit the header /
  YAML front-matter in the generated Markdown file. |

  | --resolve | options.resolve | `boolean` | `false` | Resolve external $refs,
  using the `source` parameter or the input file as the base location. |

  | --shallowSchemas | options.shallowSchemas | `boolean` | `false` | When
  referring to a schema with a $ref, don't show the full contents of the schema.
  |

  | N/A | options.source | `string` | None | The absolute location or URL of the
  source file to use as the base to resolve relative references ($refs) from;
  required if options.resolve is set to true. For CLI commands, Widdershins uses
  the input file as the base for the $refs. |

  | --summary | options.tocSummary | `boolean` | `false` | Use the operation
  summary as the TOC entry instead of the ID. |

  | --useBodyName | options.useBodyName | `boolean` | Use original param name
  for OpenAPI 2.0 body parameter. |

  | -v, --verbose | options.verbose | `boolean` | `false` | Increase verbosity.
  |

  | -h, --help | options.help | `boolean` | `false` | Show help. |

  | --version | options.version | `boolean` | `false` | Show version number. |

  | -c, --code | options.codeSamples | `boolean` | `false` | Omit generated code
  samples. |

  | --httpsnippet | options.httpsnippet | `boolean` | `false` | Use httpsnippet
  to generate code samples. |

  | -d, --discovery | options.discovery | `boolean` | `false` | Include
  schema.org WebAPI discovery data. |

  | -e, --environment | N/A | `string` | None | File to load config options
  from. |

  | -i, --includes | options.includes | `string` | None | List of files to put
  in the `include` header of the output Markdown. Processors such as Shins can
  then import the contents of these files. |

  | -l, --lang | options.lang | `boolean` | `false` | Generate the list of
  languages for code samples based on the languages used in the source file's
  `x-code-samples` examples. |

  | --language_tabs | options.language_tabs | `string` | (Differs for each input
  type) | List of language tabs for code samples using language[:label[:client]]
  format, such as `javascript:JavaScript:request`. |

  | -m, --maxDepth | options.maxDepth | `integer` | 10 | Maximum depth to show
  for schema examples. |

  | -o, --outfile | N/A | `string` | None | File to write the output markdown
  to. If left blank, Widdershins sends the output to stdout. |

  | -r, --raw | options.raw | `boolean` | `false` | Output raw schemas instead
  of example values. |

  | -s, --search | options.search | `boolean` | `true` | Set the value of the
  `search` parameter in the header so Markdown processors like Shins include
  search or not in their output. |

  | -t, --theme | options.theme | `string` | darkula | Syntax-highlighter theme
  to use. |

  | -u, --user_templates | options.user_templates | `string` | None | Directory
  to load override templates from. |

  | -x, --experimental | options.experimental | `boolean` |  | For backwards
  compatibility only; ignored. |

  | -y, --yaml | options.yaml | `boolean` | `false` | Display JSON schemas in
  YAML format. |

  called before and after each template (JavaScript code only). |

  |  | options.toc_footers | `object` | A map of `url`s and `description`s to be
  added to the ToC footers array (JavaScript code only). |


  In Node.JS code, create an options object and pass it to the Widdershins
  `convert` function, as in this example:


  ```javascript

  const converter = require('widdershins');

  let options = {}; // defaults shown

  options.codeSamples = true;

  options.httpsnippet = false;

  //options.language_tabs = [];

  //options.language_clients = [];

  //options.loadedFrom = sourceUrl; // only needed if input document is relative

  //options.user_templates = './user_templates';

  options.templateCallback = function(templateName,stage,data) { return data };

  options.theme = 'darkula';

  options.search = true;

  options.sample = true; // set false by --raw

  options.discovery = false;

  options.includes = [];

  options.shallowSchemas = false;

  options.tocSummary = false;

  options.headings = 2;

  options.yaml = false;

  //options.resolve = false;

  //options.source = sourceUrl; // if resolve is true, must be set to full path
  or URL of the input document

  converter.convert(apiObj,options)

  .then(str => {
    // str contains the converted markdown
  })

  .catch(err => {
    console.error(err);
  });

  ```


  To only include a subset of the pre-defined language-tabs, or to rename their
  display-names, you can override the `options.language_tabs`:


  ```javascript

  options.language_tabs = [{ 'go': 'Go' }, { 'http': 'HTTP' }, { 'javascript':
  'JavaScript' }, { 'javascript--node': 'Node.JS' }, { 'python': 'Python' }, {
  'ruby': 'Ruby' }];

  ```


  The `--environment` option specifies a JSON or YAML-formatted `options`
  object, for example:


  ```json

  {
    "language_tabs": [{ "go": "Go" }, { "http": "HTTP" }, { "javascript": "JavaScript" }, { "javascript--node": "Node.JS" }, { "python": "Python" }, { "ruby": "Ruby" }],
    "verbose": true,
    "tagGroups": [
      {
        "title": "Companies",
        "tags": ["companies"]
      },
      {
        "title": "Billing",
        "tags": ["invoice-create", "invoice-close", "invoice-delete"]
      }
    ]
  }

  ```


  You can also use the environment file to group OAS/Swagger tagged paths
  together to create a more elegant table of contents, and overall page
  structure.


  If you need to support a version of Slate \<v1.5.0 (or a renderer which also
  doesn't support display-names for language-tabs, such as `node-slate`,
  `slate-node` or `whiteboard`), you can use the `--environment` option with the
  included `whiteboard_env.json` file to simply achieve this.


  If you are using the `httpsnippet` option to generate code samples, you can
  specify the client library used to perform the requests for each language by
  overriding the `options.language_clients`:


  ```javascript

  options.language_clients = [{ 'shell': 'curl' }, { 'node': 'request' }, {
  'java': 'unirest' }];

  ```


  If the language name differs between the markdown name required to syntax
  highlight and the httpsnippet required target, both can be specified in the
  form `markdown--target`.


  To see the list of languages and clients supported by httpsnippet, [click
  here](https://github.com/Kong/httpsnippet/tree/master/src/targets).


  The `loadedFrom` option is only needed where the OpenAPI / Swagger definition
  does not specify a host, and (as per the OpenAPI
  [specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#fixed-fields))
  the API endpoint is deemed to be based on the source URL

  the definition was loaded from.


  To see the list of highlight-js syntax highlighting themes, [click
  here](https://highlightjs.org/static/demo/).


  Schema.org WebAPI discovery data is included if the `discovery` option above
  is set `true`. See the W3C [WebAPI Discovery Community
  Group](https://www.w3.org/community/web-api-discovery/) for more information.


  ## Language tabs


  Widdershins supports the `x-code-samples`
  [vendor-extension](https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc/blob/master/docs/redoc-vendor-extensions.md#operation-object-vendor-extensions)
  to completely customise your documentation. Alternatively, you can edit the
  default code-samples in the `templates` sub-directory, or override them using
  the `user_templates` option to specify a directory containing your templates.


  Widdershins supports the use of multiple language tabs with the same language
  (i.e. plain Javascript and Node.Js). To use this support you must be using
  Slate (or one of its ports compatible with) version 1.5.0 or higher.
  [Shins](https://github.com/mermade/shins) versions track Slate version
  numbers.


  ## Templates


  By default, Widdershins uses the templates in its `templates/` folder to
  generate the Markdown output. To customize the templates, copy some or all of
  them to a folder and pass their location to the `user_templates` parameter.


  The templates include `.dot` templates and `.def` partials. To override a
  `.dot` template, you must copy it and the child `.def` partials that the
  template references. Similarly, to override a `.def` partial, you must also
  copy the parent `.dot` template. For OpenAPI 3, the primary template is
  `main.dot` and its main child partials are `parameters.def`, `responses.def`,
  and `callbacks.def`.


  This means that it is usually easiest to copy all `.dot` and `.def` files to
  your user templates directory so you don't skip a template or partial. To
  bring in changes from Widdershins updates, you can use a visual `diff` tool
  which can run across two directories, such as [Meld](http://meldmerge.org/) or
  [WinMerge](http://winmerge.org).


  ### Template syntax


  Templates are compiled with [doT.js](https://github.com/olado/doT#readme).


  Templates have access to a `data` object with a range of properties based on
  the document context. For information about the parameters, see the README
  file for the appropriate templates:


  * [Swagger 2.0 / OpenAPI 3.0.x template
  parameters](/templates/openapi3/README.md)

  * [AsyncAPI 1.x template parameters](/templates/asyncapi1/README.md)

  * [Semoasa 0.1.0 template parameters](/templates/semoasa/README.md)


  To print the value of a parameter or variable in a template, use the code
  `{{=parameterName}}`. For example, to print the title of an OpenAPI 3 spec
  (from its `info.title` field), use the code `{{=data.api.info.title}}`.


  To loop through values in an array, use the code `{{~ arrayName
  :tempVariable}}` to start the loop and the code `{{~}}` to close the loop. For
  example, the OpenAPI 3 partial `parameters.def` uses this code to create a
  table of the parameters in an operation:

  ```

  |Name|In|Type|Required|Description|

  |---|---|---|---|---|

  {{~ data.parameters
  :p}}|{{=p.name}}|{{=p.in}}|{{=p.safeType}}|{{=p.required}}|{{=p.shortDesc ||
  'none'}}|

  {{~}}

  ```


  For if/then logic, use the code `{{? booleanExpression}}` to start the code
  block and the code `{{?}}` to close the block. For example, the OpenAPI 3
  `main.dot` template calls the `security.def` partial to show information about
  the security schemes if the OpenAPI spec includes a `securitySchemes` section:

  ```

  {{? data.api.components && data.api.components.securitySchemes }}

  {{#def.security}}

  {{?}}

  ```


  You can run arbitrary JavaScript within a template by inserting a code block
  within curly braces. For example, this code creates a variable and references
  it with normal doT.js syntax later in the template:

  ```

  {{ {

  let message = "Hello!";

  } }}


  {{=message}}

  ```


  ### Template callbacks


  The `templateCallback` parameter points to a function that Widdershins calls
  before and after each template runs. The callback function receives a `data`
  object that contains the spec that Widdershins is processing; the function
  must return this object. You can use callback functions only if you are
  calling Widdershins from JavaScript code, not from the command line.


  Widdershins passes these variables to the callback function:

  - `templateName`: The name of the template, such as `main`.

  - `stage`: Whether Widdershins is calling the callback function before (`pre`)
  or after (`post`) the template.

  - `data`: An object that contains the data that Widdershins is processing. You
  can mutate the `data` object in any way you see fit, but the function must
  return it whether it changes it or not. Content that you put in the
  `data.append` property is appended to the current output stream.


  For example, this JavaScript code prints the name of the template and the
  processing stage in the output Markdown:

  ```javascript

  'use strict';


  const converter = require('widdershins');

  const fs = require('fs');


  let options = {};

  options.templateCallback = myCallBackFunction;


  function myCallBackFunction(templateName, stage, data) {
    let statusString = "Template name: " + templateName + "\n";
    statusString += "Stage: " + stage + "\n";
    data.append = statusString;
    return data;
  }


  const apiObj = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('defs/petstore3.json'));


  converter.convert(apiObj, options)

  .then(str => {
    fs.writeFileSync('petstore3Output.md', str, 'utf8');
  });

  ```


  ## Tests


  To run a test-suite:


  ```

  node testRunner {path-to-APIs}

  ```


  The test harness currently expects `.yaml` or `.json` files and has been
  tested against


  * [APIs.guru](https://github.com/APIs-guru/OpenAPI-directory)

  * [Mermade OpenAPI definitions
  collection](https://github.com/mermade/OpenAPI-definitions)

Rebilly/generator-openapi-repo: "# create-openapi-repo\n\n[![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] [![Dependency Status][daviddm-image]][daviddm-url]\n\n> Generate an organized multi-file OpenAPI repository.\n\n<center>\n\n<img src=\"./logo.png\" width=\"500px\"/>\n\n</center>\n\n## Who?\nYou! Hello.  Do you need to write or contribute to an OpenAPI definition?  If so, read on...\n\n## What?\nWe recommend a docs-like-code approach to OpenAPI definitions:\n- Write it using your favorite text-editor or IDE (we love VSCode).\n- Organize it into multiple files and folders to make it easy to navigate.\n- Store it using source control (such as GitHub).\n- Continuously validate it using our free [openapi-cli tool](https://github.com/redocly/openapi-cli) or our free continuous validation service (coming soon).\n- Bundle it (for a smaller footprint to use in other tools or for tools that do not support a multi-file format).\n\n## Why?\nThere are a few advantages in hosting your API definition on GitHub:\n - Community engagement (PR's and issues -- if you have a public repo)\n - Advertisment in the GitHub community\n - Hosting on GitHub pages (perfect uptime, CDN, Jekyll, custom domains with CNAME)\n - Revision history, branching, CI\n - Review and approval workflows using Pull Requests\n - Fast on-boarding time (developers and tech writers know how to use GitHub :smile:)\n - Fully compatible with Redocly API Reference too\n\n There are also some advantages to a multi-file YAML format OpenAPI definition:\n - Reuse schema objects to keep things DRY (don't repeat yourself) \n - Smaller diffs compared to JSON (especially for markdown descriptions)\n - Easier to navigate\n - Easier to edit with confidence\n\n## Features\nThis generator helps to create a GitHub repo with the following features:\n - Split a big (or small) OpenAPI definition into smaller files organized into folders\n - Bundle it into a single file for deployment\n - Continuous integration/deployment on Travis or Redocly Workflows\n - Code samples as separate files\n - Automate deployment of your OpenAPI definition and docs\n - OpenAPI definition is validated after each commit\n - Live editing in your editor of choice :heart_eyes:\n\n## Structure\n\nYou will have a structure similar to this:\n```\n    ├── .redocly.yaml\n    ├── LICENSE\n    ├── README.md\n    ├── docs\n    │\_\_ ├── favicon.png\n    │\_\_ └── index.html\n    ├── openapi\n    │\_\_ ├── README.md\n    │\_\_ ├── code_samples\n    │\_\_ │\_\_ ├── C#\n    │\_\_ │\_\_ │\_\_ └── echo\n    │\_\_ │\_\_ │\_\_     └── post.cs\n    │\_\_ │\_\_ ├── PHP\n    │\_\_ │\_\_ │\_\_ └── echo\n    │\_\_ │\_\_ │\_\_     └── post.php\n    │\_\_ │\_\_ └── README.md\n    │\_\_ ├── components\n    │\_\_ │\_\_ └── README.md\n    │\_\_ └── paths\n    │\_\_     └── README.md\n    └── package.json\n```\n\nHowever, you can adjust it to any structure you prefer.\n\nThe `openapi` folder is where your OpenAPI definition will live.  Inside there, and the sub-folders, there are `README.md` files to help guide you further. This is also where your entrypoint `openapi.yaml` will live.\n\nThe `components` folder is where you will organize sub-folders such as `schema` to define your schema.\n\nThe `paths` folder is where you will organize your paths. There will be a 'README.md' file in there with suggestions for how to organize it into specially named files (or folders) that use an `@` in place of a `/` (because files cannot have a `/` character in them).  You will also be able to use path parameters by wrapping them in curly braces `{example}`.\n\nThe `.redocly.yaml` file is a universal configuration for various Redocly tools including the lint tool and reference doc engine.\n\n## Commands\n\nThe generated repository includes installing a dependency for our `openapi-cli` tool which supports commands such as `validate`, `bundle`, and more.  There are scripted shortcuts defined in the repository's `package.json`.  \n\n\n## Examples of generated repositories\n- https://github.com/Rebilly/RebillyAPI\n- https://github.com/thingful/openapi-spec\n- https://github.com/TwineHealth/TwineDeveloperDocs\n\n## How to generate your repository\n\nWe assume you already have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.\n\n- Install `create-openapi-repo` globally:\n```bash\nnpm install -g create-openapi-repo\n```\nor use [`npx`](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b):\n\nWe'll use `npx` in this example.  However, remove `npx` if you installed it globally.\n\n```bash\nnpx create-openapi-repo\n```\n\nYou will be presented with some questions. You can create a new definition or use an existing definition to initialize your project.\n\nPlease note, if you do start a new one, remember to [create a GitHub repo](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/#create-a-new-repository-on-github) where your OpenAPI definition will live.\n\nIf you use the prior version of this generated repository, please read the following upgrade instructions.\n\n#### Upgrading from a prior version\n\nMigrate your repository from a previous structure of OpenAPI repo to this newer structure with our migration tool. \n\nRun this in the root folder of your repo.\n\n```bash\nnpx create-openapi-repo --migrate-2-3\n```\n\nNote: the migration tool does not migrate plugins automatically. You would need to manually add them to the `transformers` folder. \n\n## Support\n\nThank you for wanting to support us. Here are some ideas how to support us:\n\n* Star us\n* Tell a friend or colleague about us (or Tweet about us)\n* Write an article about it (and let us know) -- open an issue to let us know, with the link.\n* Consider our commercial products if are looking for automation to ease the docs-like code workflow, hosting along with conveniences like custom domains, access controls and previews, API reference documentation, or a full developer portal:  https://redoc.ly\n\n[npm-image]: https://badge.fury.io/js/generator-openapi-repo.svg\n[npm-url]: https://npmjs.org/package/generator-openapi-repo\n[daviddm-image]: https://david-dm.org/Rebilly/generator-openapi-repo.svg?theme=shields.io\n[daviddm-url]: https://david-dm.org/Rebilly/generator-openapi-repo\n"

  # The apicurio-studio project (Open Source API Design Studio)


  ## Summary


  This is the official Git repository for the apicurio studio project: 
  http://www.apicur.io/


  The apicurio studio project is a standalone API design studio that can be used
  to create

  new or edit existing API designs (using the OpenAPI specification).


  ## Get the code


  The easiest way to get started with the code is to [create your own
  fork](http://help.github.com/forking/)

  of this repository, and then clone your fork:

  ```bash
    $ git clone git@github.com:<you>/apicurio-studio.git
    $ cd apicurio-studio
    $ git remote add upstream git://github.com/apicurio/apicurio-studio.git
  ```

  At any time, you can pull changes from the upstream and merge them onto your
  master:

  ```bash
    $ git checkout master               # switches to the 'master' branch
    $ git pull upstream master          # fetches all 'upstream' changes and merges 'upstream/master' onto your 'master' branch
    $ git push origin                   # pushes all the updates to your fork, which should be in-sync with 'upstream'
  ```

  The general idea is to keep your 'master' branch in-sync with the
  'upstream/master'.


  ## Building apicurio-studio


  ### Requirements

  - Maven 3.x

  - Java 8+


  The following command compiles all the code, installs the JARs into your local
  Maven repository, and runs all of the unit tests:

  ```bash
    $ mvn clean install
  ```

  ## Quickstart (i.e. How To Run It)


  The fastest way to get started using Apicurio Studio is to use the
  quickstart.  The Apicurio quickstart is produced as part 

  of the full maven build - you can find it in `distro/quickstart/target` as a
  ZIP file.  To start up the quickstart, use the 

  following commands from the top-level of the repository:


  ```bash
    $ rm -rf ./distro/quickstart/target/apicurio-studio-*-SNAPSHOT
    $ unzip distro/quickstart/target/apicurio-studio-*-quickstart.zip -d distro/quickstart/target
    $ ./distro/quickstart/target/apicurio-studio-*-SNAPSHOT/bin/standalone.sh -c standalone-apicurio.xml
  ```


  This will start Wildfly on your local machine and you can access the UI at
  [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).


  ## Contribute fixes and features


  Apicurio Studio is open source, and we welcome anybody who wants to
  participate and contribute!


  Please follow [Setting your development
  environment](https://apicurio-studio.readme.io/docs/setting-up-a-development-environment)
  guide to setup your local machine for development.  The guide assumes the use
  of the Eclipse IDE for Java

  development (backend) but is not required - developers should be able to adapt
  the instructions to their particular

  environment.


  If you want to fix a bug or make any changes, please [log an issue in
  GitHub](https://github.com/apicurio/apicurio-studio/issues) describing the bug

  or new feature. Then we highly recommend making the changes on a topic branch
  named with the JIRA issue number. For example, this command creates

  a branch for the APISTUDIO-1234 issue:

  ```bash
    $ git checkout -b apicurio-studio-1234
  ```

  After you're happy with your changes and a full build (with unit tests) runs
  successfully, commit your

  changes on your topic branch. Then it's time to check for and pull any recent
  changes that were made in

  the official repository:

  ```bash
    $ git checkout master               # switches to the 'master' branch
    $ git pull upstream master          # fetches all 'upstream' changes and merges 'upstream/master' onto your 'master' branch
    $ git checkout apicurio-studio-1234   # switches to your topic branch
    $ git rebase master                 # reapplies your changes on top of the latest in master
                                        # (i.e., the latest from master will be the new base for your changes)
  ```

  If the pull grabbed a lot of changes, you should rerun your build to make sure
  your changes are still good.

  You can then either [create patches](http://progit.org/book/ch5-2.html) (one
  file per commit, saved in `~/apicurio-studio-1234`) with

  ```bash
    $ git format-patch -M -o ~/apicurio-studio-1234 orgin/master
  ```

  and upload them to the JIRA issue, or you can push your topic branch and its
  changes into your public fork repository

  ```bash
    $ git push origin apicurio-studio-1234         # pushes your topic branch into your public fork of apicurio-studio
  ```

  and [generate a pull-request](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/) for your
  changes.


  We prefer pull-requests, because we can review the proposed changes, comment
  on them,

  discuss them with you, and likely merge the changes right into the official
  repository.


  Please try to create one commit per feature or fix, generally the easiest way
  to do this is via [git
  squash](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Squashing-Commits).

  This makes reverting changes easier, and avoids needlessly polluting the
  repository history with checkpoint commits.


  ## Code Formatting


  When you are hacking on some apicurio-studio code, we'd really appreciate it
  if you followed the

  apicurio-studio coding standards.  If you're using Eclipse, you can find a
  code formatter config

  file here:

  ```

  tools/src/eclipse/apicurio-eclipse-formatter.xml

  ```

  You should be able to import that guy straight into Eclipse by going to

  *Window->Preferences :: Java/Code Style/Formatter*
apiacademy/rapido-web: "# rápido-web\r\n\r\nRapido is an API design tool that facilitates the _sketching_ phase of design.  At a minimum, a sketch should be:\r\n\r\n* easy to create\r\n* easy to dispose\r\n* easy to translate into a prototype\r\n\r\nSketching allows a designer to perform many iterations of an early design if the cost of creation is very low.  This promotes experimentation and ideation.  Early iterations are important for API design as it is difficult to change an API once it is released and being used.\r\n\r\n## Rapido Design Principles\r\n\r\n1.  Rapid design - a user should be able to create a complete API sketch within five minutes\r\n2.  Safe Disposability - users should feel safe when starting a design over (through archiving and peristence of previous designs )\r\n3.  Unidirectional - Rapido sketches can be exported to later lifecycle stages, but designs cannot be imported.  \r\n\r\n## Development Setup\r\n\r\nRapido requires NodeJS and npm and a [backend Rapido](http://github.com/apiacademy/rapido-backend) implementation.\r\n\r\nTo install:\r\n`npm install`\r\n\r\nTo start:\r\n`npm start`\r\n\r\nTo test with Chrome:\r\n'npm test'\r\n"

  OpenAPI-GUI

  ===========


  OpenAPI-GUI is a GUI for creating and editing OpenAPI version 3.0.x JSON/YAML
  definitions. In its current form it is most useful as a tool for starting off
  and editing simple OpenAPI definitions. Imported OpenAPI 2.0 definitions are
  automatically converted to v3.0.


  ![Screenshot](https://github.com/Mermade/openapi-gui/blob/master/img/screenshot.png?raw=true)


  For the previous Swagger / OpenAPI 2.0-only version see
  [here](https://mikeralphson.github.io/openapi-gui). This version is currently
  **unmaintained** apart from security fixes.


  This project was initially a fork of [Daryl Kuhn's
  IODoctor](https://github.com/darrylkuhn/iodoctor/tree/angular-port), which in
  turn was inspired by [IODoctor by Brandon
  West](https://github.com/brandonmwest/iodoctor) which was written in Ruby. The
  complete history of the project is maintained on GitHub.


  Description

  -----------

  ### How It Works


  Select an existing OpenAPI 2.0 or 3.0.x definition to upload, or create a new
  definition and start adding Paths, Operations, and Parameters. When an
  existing definition is used, it is parsed and forms for editing each Path,
  Operation and Parameter will be created.


  You can load an existing definition by appending a `?url=` query parameter to
  the initial start page.


  Click an item from the menu on the left to begin editing. View the JSON/YAML
  output at any time by selecting one of the "Export" tabs. When finished,
  download the output to save it locally or copy it your clipboard. OpenAPI-GUI
  only stores one definition at a time, and this is in your browser's
  local-storage. Make sure you save your JSON/YAML output locally.


  Before performing a destructive action, OpenAPI-GUI saves the current state of
  the definition. At all other times you must remember to select Save manually.


  ### Technology


  OpenAPI-GUI runs entirely client-side using a number of Javascript frameworks
  including [Vue.JS](https://vuejs.org/), [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) and
  [Bulma](http://bulma.io/) for CSS.


  To get the app up and running just browse to [the live version on GitHub
  pages](https://mermade.github.io/openapi-gui), deploy a clone to GitHub pages,
  deploy to Heroku using the button below, or clone the repo and point a browser
  at `index.html` or host it yourself - couldn't be simpler. More [technical
  information here](docs/technical.md).


  You only need to `npm install` the Node.js modules if you wish to use the
  `openapi-gui` embedded web server (i.e. not if you are running your own
  web-server), otherwise they are only there for PaaS deployments.


  [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)


  #### CLI options


  ```

  -d, --definition    serve the given OAS definition

  -l, --launch        start a web-browser pointing to the GUI

  -p, --port          specify the port to run on, defaults to $PORT or 3000

  -w, --write         enable writing back to the source definition

  ```


  #### Running with Docker


  If you don't have a local Node development environment, or if you would prefer
  to run OpenAPI-GUI in a Docker container, you can do in with a few simple
  steps:


  1. Clone the repository.

  2. Run `docker build -t mermade/openapi-gui .` to build the Docker image
  (`mermade/openapi-gui`)

  3. Run `docker run --name openapi-gui -p 8080:3000 -d mermade/openapi-gui` to
  run the server on port 8080.

  4. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080` in your favorite browser.

  5. When you're done, shut down the server by running `docker stop openapi-gui
  && docker rm openapi-gui`


  Or you can pull the pre-built Docker image:


  * `docker pull mermade/openapi-gui`


  ### Limitations


  * OpenAPI-GUI will de-reference shared parameters.

  * The definition must be self-contained with no external `$ref`s. **This is
  likely to be resolved (ho-ho) soon**.

  * Editing a response / example / body schema will dereference it.

  * OpenAPI-GUI will not always preserve vendor-extensions, e.g. if a parameter
  is deleted and recreated.

  * OpenAPI-GUI will not preserve comments from definitions imported in YAML
  format.

  # Express Gateway OpenAPI 3 Mock Server Plugin


  [![npm
  version](https://badge.fury.io/js/express-gateway-plugin-openapi3-mock-server.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/express-gateway-plugin-openapi3-mock-server)


  **_This plugin is under active development. Would you meet any problems,
  please open a new issue

  after verifying that there isn't one already._**


  ## Prerequisites


  Please follow the instructions on Express Gateway's [Getting
  started](http://www.express-gateway.io/getting-started/) page.


  Also please take a look at how plugins are [installed and
  enabled](http://www.express-gateway.io/docs/plugins/).


  ## Installation


  `eg plugin install express-gateway-plugin-openapi3-mock-server`


  ## Configuration


  You can use `samples/base-paths.yml` for testing purposes. If so, please
  create a `definitions` folder

  in the project root and copy the sample YAML there.


  _system.config.yml_


  ```yaml

  # some config in front of the plugins section


  plugins:
    express-gateway-plugin-openapi3-mock-server:
      definitionFile: 'definitions/yourdefinition.yml' # The file containing your API's specification

  # some config after the plugins section

  ```


  _gateway.config.yml_ (A barebone example, if nothing else is used.)


  ```yaml

  http:
    port: 80
  apiEndpoints:
    api:
      host: '*'
  policies:
    - mock
  pipelines:
    api:
      apiEndpoints:
          - api
      policies:
          - mock:
            - action
  ```

  The above configuration disables the Admin CLI and will do nothing but provide
  a dummy responder based on your 

  OpenAPI specification.


  ## Features


  * Endpoints with appropriate request types are parsed and the first response
  example is used as a response body.

  * HTTP and apiKey auth header check support


  ### To do


  * Accept header checks to return appropriate response example

  * X-* headers for testing error responses

  * X-* headers for response example selection

  * Input parameter validation

  * Generators for random response data based on provided schema

  Installation

  --------------------------

  Install using [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm/):


  ```bash

  npm install -g @apidevtools/swagger-cli

  ```




  Usage

  --------------------------


  ```

  swagger-cli <command> [options] <file>


  Commands:
      validate                Validates an API definition in Swagger 2.0 or OpenAPI 3.0 format

      bundle                  Bundles a multi-file API definition into a single file

  Options:
      -h, --help              Show help for any command
      -v, --version           Output the CLI version number
      -d, --debug [filter]    Show debug output, optionally filtered (e.g. "*", "swagger:*", etc.)
  ```



  ### Validate an API


  The `swagger-cli validate` command will validate your Swagger/OpenAPI
  definition against the [Swagger 2.0
  schema](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/schemas/v2.0/schema.json)
  or [OpenAPI 3.0
  Schema](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/schemas/v3.0/schema.json). 
  It also performs additional validations against the
  [specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md),
  which will catch some things that aren't covered by the schema, such as
  duplicate parameters, invalid MIME types, etc.


  The command will exit with a non-zero code if the API is invalid.


  ```

  swagger-cli validate [options] <file>


  Options:
      --no-schema             Do NOT validate against the Swagger/OpenAPI JSON schema

      --no-spec               Do NOT validate against the Swagger/OpenAPI specification
  ```


  #### Git pre-commit hook


  There is a useful Python tool called [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)
  that can be used to execute a wide suite of pre-commit checks. The
  `swagger-cli validate` command can be integrated as part of a git pre-commit
  hook by adding the following configuration to the `repos` entry of an existing
  `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file.


  ```

  -   repo: https://github.com/APIDevTools/swagger-cli
      rev: v2.2.1
      hooks:
      - id: swagger-validation
        args: ["validate", "<path to root swagger>"]
  ```


  The intention is to point to single root swagger that references multiple
  swagger definitions. The above hook will execute the `swagger-cli validation`
  against the root swagger anytime that a file matching the pattern
  `.*swagger.*\.(json|yaml|yml)` is modified. Any failures in this validation
  will prevent the git commit from being processed.


  ### Combine Multiple Files


  The Swagger and OpenAPI specs allows you to split your API definition across
  multiple files using [`$ref`
  pointers](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#reference-object)
  to reference each file. You can use the `swagger-cli bundle` command to
  combine all of those referenced files into a single file, which is useful for
  distribution or interoperation with other tools.


  By default, the `swagger-cli bundle` command tries to keep the output file
  size as small as possible, by only embedding each referenced file _once_.  If
  the same file is referenced multiple times, then any subsequent references are
  simply modified to point to the _single_ inlined copy of the file.  If you
  want to produce a bundled file without _any_ `$ref` pointers, then add the
  `--dereference` option.  This will result in a larger file size, since
  multiple references to the same file will result in that file being embedded
  multiple times.


  If you don't specify the `--output-file` option, then the bundled API will be
  written to stdout, which means you can pipe it to other commands.


  The result of this method by default is written as JSON. It can be changed to
  YAML with the `--type` option, by passing the `yaml` value.


  ```

  swagger-cli bundle [options] <file>


  Options:
      -o, --outfile <file>        The output file

      -r, --dereference           Fully dereference all $ref pointers

      -f, --format <spaces>       Formats the output using the given number of spaces
                                  (the default is 2 spaces)

      -t, --type <filetype>       Defines the output file type. The valid values are: json, yaml
                                  (the default is JSON)

      -w, --wrap <column>         Set the line length for YAML strings
                                  (the default is no wrapping)
  ```

  # Docker


  Available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/joschi/openapi-diff/) as
  `joschi/openapi-diff`.


  ```bash

  # docker run joschi/openapi-diff:latest

                                  compatible
      --fail-on-incompatible      Fail only if API changes broke backward

      --warn                      Print warning information
  ```



  ## Build the image


  This is only required if you want to try new changes in the Dockerfile of this
  project.


  ```bash

  docker build -t local-openapi-diff .

  ```


  You can replace the local image name `local-openapi-diff` by any name of your
  choice.


  ## Run an instance


  In this example the `$(pwd)/core/src/test/resources` directory is mounted in
  the `/specs` directory of the container

  in readonly mode (`ro`).


  ```bash

  docker run -t \
    -v $(pwd)/core/src/test/resources:/specs:ro \
    joschi/openapi-diff /specs/path_1.yaml /specs/path_2.yaml
  ```


  The remote name `joschi/openapi-diff` can be replaced with
  `local-openapi-diff` or the name you gave to your local image.


  # Usage


  openapi-diff can read OpenAPI specs from JSON files or HTTP URLs.


  ## Command Line


  ```bash

  $ openapi-diff --help

  usage: openapi-diff <old> <new>
      --debug                     Print debugging information

  ## Direct Invocation


  ```java

  public class Main {
      public static final String OPENAPI_DOC1 = "petstore_v3_1.json";
      public static final String OPENAPI_DOC2 = "petstore_v2_2.yaml";
          
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          ChangedOpenApi diff = OpenApiCompare.fromLocations(OPENAPI_DOC1, OPENAPI_DOC2);

          //...
      }
  }

  ```


  ### Render difference

  ---

  #### HTML


  ```java

  String html = new HtmlRender("Changelog",
          "http://deepoove.com/swagger-diff/stylesheets/demo.css")
                  .render(diff);

  try {
      FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(
              "testNewApi.html");
      fw.write(html);
      fw.close();

  } catch (IOException e) {
      e.printStackTrace();
  }

  ```


  #### Markdown


  ```java

  String render = new MarkdownRender().render(diff);

  try {
      FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(
              "testDiff.md");
      fw.write(render);
      fw.close();
      
  } catch (IOException e) {
      e.printStackTrace();
  }

  ```


  ### Extensions


  This project uses Java Service Provider Inteface (SPI) so additional
  extensions can be added. 


  To build your own extension, you simply need to create a
  `src/main/resources/META-INF/services/com.qdesrame.openapi.diff.core.compare.ExtensionDiff`
  file with the full classname of your implementation.  Your class must also
  implement the `com.qdesrame.openapi.diff.core.compare.ExtensionDiff`
  interface.  Then, including your library with the `openapi-diff` module will
  cause it to be triggered automatically.

  # openapi-filter


  ![ci](https://github.com/Mermade/openapi-filter/workflows/ci/badge.svg)


  Filter internal paths, operations, parameters, schemas etc from
  OpenAPI/Swagger/AsyncAPI definitions.


  Simply flag any object within the definition with an `x-internal`
  specification extension, and it will be removed from the output.


  For example:


  ```yaml

  openapi: 3.0.0

  info:
    title: API
    version: 1.0.0
  paths:
    /:
      get:
        x-internal: true
        ...
  ```


  Works with OpenAPI/Swagger 2.0 and 3.0.x and AsyncAPI definitions.


  ```

  openapi-filter.js <infile> [outfile]


  Positionals:
    infile   the input file
    outfile  the output file

  Options:

    --info           include complete info object with --valid           [boolean]
    --inverse, -i    output filtered elements only                       [boolean]
    --flags, -f      flags to filter by          [array] [default: ["x-internal"]]
    --flagValues, -v flag String values to match             [array] [default: []]
    --checkTags      filter if flags given in --flags are in the tags array
                                                                         [boolean]
    --overrides, -o  prefixes used to override named properties[arr] [default: []]
    --valid          try to ensure inverse output is valid               [boolean]
    --strip, -s      strip the flags from the finished product           [boolean]
    --servers        include complete servers object with --valid        [boolean]
    --lineWidth, -l  max line width of yaml output           [number] [default: 0]
    --maxAliasCount  maximum YAML aliases allowed          [number] [default: 100]
    --configFile     The file & path for the filter options                 [path]
    --help           Show help                                           [boolean]
    --verbose        Output more details of the filter process             [count]
  ```


  use `--` to separate flags or other array options from following options,
  i.e.:


  `openapi-filter --flags x-private x-hidden -- source.yaml target.yaml`


  or


  ```javascript

  let openapiFilter = require('openapi-filter');

  let options = {}; // defaults are shown

  //options.inverse = false;

  //options.valid = false;

  //options.flags = ['x-internal'];

  let res = openapiFilter.filter(obj,options);

  ```


  See the [wiki](https://github.com/Mermade/openapi-filter/wiki) for further
  examples.

  const options = {};

  // options.path = '...';

  // options.method = '...';

  // options.operationid = ['...'];

  const res = openapiExtractor.extract(obj, options);


  const map = openapiExtractor.shard(obj, options);

  ```


  The `options` object takes the same values as the CLI, for these keys and
  default values:


  *   path = ''

  *   method = ''

  *   info = false

  *   openai = false

  *   removeDocs = false

  *   removeExamples = false

  *   removeExtensions = false

  *   server = false

  *   security = false

  *   operationid = []


  ## OpenAI compliant mode


  This option turns on the following rules:

EiffelWebFramework/swagger: |
  Swagger
  =======

  This is a Swagger protocol implementation in Eiffel.

  Note: This is a work in progress, and the API could change in a future.

SmartBear/swagger4j: >
  ## swagger4j


  A simple java library for reading and writing [Swagger 1.X
  definitions](https://swagger.io). Supports both JSON and XML formats. The
  current version is

  reasonably in line with the latest swagger core release except that it doesn't
  support any of the JSON Schema/Data Model constructs yet. Apache 2.0 licensed.


  If you're interested in reading Swagger 2.0 definitions you're better off
  using the official
  [swagger-parser](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-parser)


  ### Getting started


  Clone this repo from GitHub and build it yourself with maven (with "mvn
  install"). 


  The latest version is also available in the SmartBear maven repository at
  soapui.org, add this to your pom with


  ```xml

  <repositories>
      <repository>
          <id>soapUI Repository</id>
          <url>http://www.soapui.org/repository/maven2</url>
      </repository>
  </repositories>

  ```


  and add the corresponding dependency:


  ```xml

  <dependency>
      <groupId>com.smartbear</groupId>
      <artifactId>swagger4j</artifactId>
      <version>1.0.0</version>
  </dependency>

  ```


  swagger4j has a runtime dependency

  on jsonp
  ([https://java.net/projects/jsonp/](https://java.net/projects/jsonp/)) which
  you can add to your maven pom with.


  ```xml

  <dependency>
      <groupId>org.glassfish</groupId>
      <artifactId>javax.json</artifactId>
      <version>1.0-b06</version>
  </dependency>

  ```


  Once added to your classpath you can start reading swagger definitions, for
  example


  ```java

  ResourceListing resourceListing = Swagger.readSwagger(
  "http://petstore.swagger.wordnik.com/api/api-docs.json" )

  for( ResourceListingApi apiRef : resourceListing.getApis() )

  {
     ApiDeclaration apiDeclaration = apiRef.getDeclaration();
     for( Api api : apiDeclaration.getApis())
     {
         ...
     }
  }

  ```


  and of course you can write them as well


  ```java

  SwaggerFactory factory = Swagger.createSwaggerFactory();


  ApiDeclaration apiDeclaration = factory.createApiDeclaration(
  "http://api.mycompany.com/apis", "/user" );

  Api api = apiDeclaration.addApi( "{id}" );

  Operation op = api.addOperation( "getuserbyid", Operation.Method.GET );

  op.addParameter( "id", Parameter.ParamType.path );


  ResourceListing rl = factory.createResourceListing(
  "http://api.mycompany.com/apis" );

  rl.setApiVersion( "1.0" );

  rl.addApi( apiDeclaration, "user-doc.{format}" );


  Swagger.writerSwagger( rl, "api-docs" );

  ```


  The API is closely modeled after the Swagger specification, if you are
  familiar with that it should be a breeze to use.

  If you aren't familiar with Swagger and its spec head right over to the
  swagger website at 

  [https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-core/wiki](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-core/wiki)
  to learn all about it.


  Javadoc is available in the zip at sourceforge.


  ### Library Design


  Swagger4j uses a standard Factory/Builder approach with interfaces defining
  the entire Swagger object model and a

  default implementation implementing them. If you have any suggestions on how
  to improve the actual API please don't

  hesitate to get in touch by adding tickets here at GitHub for bugs, issues,
  feature requests - Thank you!


  Please note the following:

  - the whole DataModel/DataType part of Swagger is not yet supported

  - paths to APIs referred to in a ResourceListing are resolved by adding the
  path of the api to the basePath defined

  in the resourceListing. If the basePath is relative - it is resolved
  relatively to the host/root of the ResourceListing

  URI.


  ### Usages


  * Version 0.2+ of the SoapUI-Swagger-Plugin use swagger4j to parse and
  generate Swagger definitions.


  ### Future improvements


  * None planned at this point!


  ### Release History


  * 20130527 - Initial beta1 release

  * 20131119 - beta2 release, adds support for Swagger 1.2 and 1.0

  * 20140505 - beta3 bugfixes

  * 20140512 - beta4 more bugfixes

  * 20151029 - 1.0.0 release - more bugfixes

This basic REST design principle establishes a one-to-one mapping between create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations and HTTP methods. According to this mapping:\n\n- GET = Retrieve a representation of a resource\n- POST = Create if you are sending content to the server to create a subordinate of the specified resource collection, using some server-side algorithm.\n- PUT = Create if you are sending the full content of the specified resource (URI).\n- PUT = Update if you are updating the full content of the specified resource.\n- DELETE = Delete if you are requesting the server to delete the resource\n- PATCH = Update partial content of a resource\n- OPTIONS = Get information about the communication options for the request URI\n    \n### Usage\n\n#### Without Go Modules\n\nAll versions up to `v2.*.*` (on the master) are not supporting Go modules.\n\n```\nimport (\n\trestful \"github.com/emicklei/go-restful\"\n)\n```\n\n#### Using Go Modules\n\nAs of version `v3.0.0` (on the v3 branch), this package supports Go modules.\n\n```\nimport (\n\trestful \"github.com/emicklei/go-restful/v3\"\n)\n```\n\n### Example\n\n```Go\nws := new(restful.WebService)\nws.\n\tPath(\"/users\").\n\tConsumes(restful.MIME_XML, restful.MIME_JSON).\n\tProduces(restful.MIME_JSON, restful.MIME_XML)\n\nws.Route(ws.GET(\"/{user-id}\").To(u.findUser).\n\tDoc(\"get a user\").\n\tParam(ws.PathParameter(\"user-id\", \"identifier of the user\").DataType(\"string\")).\n\tWrites(User{}))\t\t\n...\n\t\nfunc (u UserResource) findUser(request *restful.Request, response *restful.Response) {\n\tid := request.PathParameter(\"user-id\")\n\t...\n}\n```\n\t\n[Full API of a UserResource](https://github.com/emicklei/go-restful/blob/v3/examples/user-resource/restful-user-resource.go) \n\t\t\n### Features\n\n- Routes for request &#8594; function mapping with path parameter (e.g. {id} but also prefix_{var} and {var}_suffix) support\n- Configurable router:\n\t- (default) Fast routing algorithm that allows static elements, [google custom method](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/custom_methods), regular expressions and dynamic parameters in the URL path (e.g. /resource/name:customVerb, /meetings/{id} or /static/{subpath:*})\n\t- Routing algorithm after [JSR311](http://jsr311.java.net/nonav/releases/1.1/spec/spec.html) that is implemented using (but does **not** accept) regular expressions\n- Request API for reading structs from JSON/XML and accessing parameters (path,query,header)\n- Response API for writing structs to JSON/XML and setting headers\n- Customizable encoding using EntityReaderWriter registration\n- Filters for intercepting the request &#8594; response flow on Service or Route level\n- Request-scoped variables using attributes\n- Containers for WebServices on different HTTP endpoints\n- Content encoding (gzip,deflate) of request and response payloads\n- Automatic responses on OPTIONS (using a filter)\n- Automatic CORS request handling (using a filter)\n- API declaration for Swagger UI ([go-restful-openapi](https://github.com/emicklei/go-restful-openapi))\n- Panic recovery to produce HTTP 500, customizable using RecoverHandler(...)\n- Route errors produce HTTP 404/405/406/415 errors, customizable using ServiceErrorHandler(...)\n- Configurable (trace) logging\n- Customizable gzip/deflate readers and writers using CompressorProvider registration\n- Inject your own http.Handler using the `HttpMiddlewareHandlerToFilter` function\n\n## How to customize\nThere are several hooks to customize the behavior of the go-restful package.\n\n- Router algorithm\n- Panic recovery\n- JSON decoder\n- Trace logging\n- Compression\n- Encoders for other serializers\n- Use [jsoniter](https://github.com/json-iterator/go) by building this package using a build tag, e.g. `go build -tags=jsoniter .` \n- Use the package variable `TrimRightSlashEnabled` (default true) to control the behavior of matching routes that end with a slash `/` \n\n## Resources\n\n- [Example programs](./examples)\n- [Example posted on blog](http://ernestmicklei.com/2012/11/go-restful-first-working-example/)\n- [Design explained on blog](http://ernestmicklei.com/2012/11/go-restful-api-design/)\n- [sourcegraph](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/emicklei/go-restful)\n- [showcase: Zazkia - tcp proxy for testing resiliency](https://github.com/emicklei/zazkia)\n- [showcase: Mora - MongoDB REST Api server](https://github.com/emicklei/mora)\n\nType ```git shortlog -s``` for a full list of contributors.\n\n© 2012 - 2023, http://ernestmicklei.com.

  Git Repository and the Branches

  -------------------------------


  1. Most stable and recent version is at the `master` branch, previous versions
  are in the version branches such
     as `v4`, `v3`, `v2`, and `v1`.

  2. Version branch with the current version such as `v5` is used for building
  up the next release. It's documentation may
     not be updated frequently and thus reserved for the daring ones.

  3. Feature branches such as `features/html` and `features/router` are purely
  for experimentation purpose to try out a
     feature. They may be merged when ready.

  Test Drive

  ----------


  Install this repository to try out the examples.


  > Make sure PHP 5.4 or above is available on your server. We recommended using
  the latest version for better performance.


  ### 1. Install Composer


  Restler uses [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) to manage its dependencies.
  First, download a copy of `composer.phar`.

  It can be kept in your project folder or ideally in `usr/local/bin` to use it
  globally for all your projects. If you are

  on Windows, you can use the composer

  [windows installer](https://getcomposer.org/Composer-Setup.exe) instead.


  ### 2. Install Restler


  #### Option 1. Using composer create-project


  You may install Restler by running the create project command in your
  terminal. Replace {projectName} with your actual

  project name. It will create a folder with that name and install Restler.


  ```console

  php composer.phar create-project luracast/restler {projectName}

  ```


  > **Note:-**

  >

  > 1. If you do not want the additional formats and BDD tools you can include
       >    `--no-dev` to enforce exclusion of dev packages.
  >

  > 2. If you want to try the bleading edge v3 branch or any of the feature
       >    branches include `3.x-dev` or `dev-features/html` in the above command

  #### Option 2. Downloading from GitHub


  After installing Composer, download the [latest version]() of the Restler
  framework and extract its contents into a

  directory on your server. Next, in the root of your Restler project, run the
  `php composer.phar install`

  (or `composer install`) command to install all the framework's dependencies.
  This process requires Git to be installed

  on the server to successfully complete the installation.


  If you want to update the Restler framework, you may issue the

  `php composer.phar update` command.


  > **Note:-** If you are not allowed to install composer and git on your
  server, you

  > can install and run them on your development machine. The resulting files
  and

  > folders can be uploaded and used on the server.


  ### 3. Configure


  Ideally public folder should be mapped as your web root, It is optional, but
  recommended avoiding exposing unneeded

  files and folders.


  ### 4. Try it out


  Try the live examples in your localhost. 

  > You may launch the PHP's built-in server with `composer serve` command.


  ### 5. Run some test


  Update the base_url specified in `behat.yml` and then try the following
  command


  ```console


  vendor/bin/behat


  ```

  > alternatively you can run `composer test`


  This will test the examples against the behaviors expected, for example


  ```gherkin


  Feature: Testing CRUD Example

    Scenario: Creating new Author with JSON
      Given that I want to make a new "Author"
      And his "name" is "Chris"
      And his "email" is "chris@world.com"
      And the request is sent as JSON
      When I request "/examples/_007_crud/authors"
      Then the response status code should be 200
      And the response should be JSON
      And the response has a "id" property

  ```


  All set, Happy RESTling! :)


  Quick Start Guide

  -----------------


  We have two options to create your own restler api server

   1. Most convenient option is using application templates such as [Restler Application](https://github.com/Luracast/Restler-Framework) 
      which has integrations with many packages to help us with the business logic as well. 
      If you choose this option, select a branch in that repository and proceed with 
      the instructions available there.
      
   2. Create a project from scratch so that you have full control over every aspect of your application. 
      If you choose this option, follow along with the steps below.
      - create a folder to hold your project and open it in the terminal.
      - run `composer init` and follow along to create `composer.json`
      - when it is asking for dependencies, type `restler/framework` and `^5` for the version constraint.
      - alternatively, you can leave it blank and create the composer.json first and then run `composer require restler/framework:^5`

  ### 1. Write API


  Create your **API classes** with all needed public and protected methods


  ### 2. Open the Gateway


  Create the **gateway (public/index.php)** as follows


  ```php

  <?php

  require_once __DIR__.'/../vendor/autoload.php';


  use Luracast\Restler\Restler;


  $r = new Restler();

  $r->addAPIClass('YourApiClassNameHere'); // repeat for more

  $r->handle(); //serve the response

  ```


  ### 3. Prettify URLs


  **Enable URL Rewriting**


  Make sure all the requests go to index.php by enabling URL Rewriting for your
  website


  For example:-


  If you are on Apache, you can use an .htaccess file such as


  ```apache

  DirectoryIndex index.php

  <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
      RewriteEngine On
      RewriteRule ^$ index.php [QSA,L]
      RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
      RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
      RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php [QSA,L]
  </IfModule>

  <IfModule mod_php5.c>
      php_flag display_errors On
  </IfModule>

  ```


  > **Note:-** This requires `AllowOverride` to be set to `All` instead of
  `None`

  > in the `httpd.conf` file, and might require some tweaking on some server

  > configurations. Refer to
  [mod_rewrite](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_rewrite.html)

  > documentation for more info.


  If you are on Nginx, you have to make sure you set the `server_name` and pass
  the PHP scripts to fast cgi (PHP-FPM)

  listening on 127.0.0.1:9000


  ```

  server {
      listen        80;
      server_name   api.luracast.com; //change it to match your server name

      //... other stuff

      location ~ \.php$ {
          root           /var/www/html;
          fastcgi_pass   127.0.0.1:9000;
          fastcgi_index  index.php;
          fastcgi_param  SCRIPT_FILENAME  /var/www/html/$fastcgi_script_name;
          include        fastcgi_params;
      }

      //... other stuff
  }

  ```


  > **Note:-** This requires PHP, PHP-FPM to be properly installed and
  configured.

  > Refer to [PHP FastCGI](http://wiki.nginx.org/PHPFcgiExample) example for
  more

  > info.


  ### 4. Customise


  **Fine tune to suit your needs**


  ```php

  <?php

  require_once __DIR__.'/../vendor/autoload.php';

  use Luracast\Restler\Restler;

  use Luracast\Restler\Defaults;

  //set the defaults to match your requirements

  Defaults::$throttle = 20; //time in milliseconds for bandwidth throttling

  //setup restler

  $r = new Restler();

  $r->addAPIClass('YourApiClassNameHere'); // repeat for more

  $r->addAPIClass('Explorer'); //from restler framework for API Explorer

  $r->addFilterClass('RateLimit'); //Add Filters as needed

  $r->handle(); //serve the response

  ```


  Explore the api and try it out by openings `explorer/index.html` from the web
  root on your browser


  Happy Exploring! :)


  > **Note:-** Using eAccelerator can make restler to fail as it removes the

  > comments. More info can be found
  [here](http://wildlyinaccurate.com/eaccelerator-and-doctrine-2)


  ### 5. Annotate


  Restler supports annotations in the form of PHPDoc comments for API fine
  tuning


  They are documented in detail under [Annotations](ANNOTATIONS.md)


  ### 6. Authorize


  In order to protect your api, authenticate and allow valid users


  ```php

  <?php

  require_once '../restler.php';

  use Luracast\Restler\Restler;

  $r = new Restler();

  $r->addAPIClass('YourApiClassNameHere'); // repeat for more

  $r->addAuthenticationClass('CustomAuth'); //Add Authentication classes as
  needed

  $r->handle(); //serve the response

  ```


  ### 7. Start Production


  By default Restler runs in debug mode more fine tuned for API developer, by
  showing detailed error messages and

  prettifying the api result to human readbale form


  By turning on production mode you will gain some performance boost as it will
  cache the routes (comment parsing happens

  only once instead of every api call), few other files and avoid giving out
  debug information


  ```php

  <?php

  require_once '../restler.php';

  use Luracast\Restler\Restler;


  //setup restler


  $r = new Restler(true); //turn on production mode by passing true.

  //If you are using file based cache (the default) make sure cache folder is

  //writable. when you make changes to your code make sure you delete the

  // routes.php inside the cache folder

  //...

  ```

  >*Note:-* When production mode is set to `true` it always uses the cache and
  does not detect 

  > changes and new routes if any. Your continuous integration pipeline or your
  git hook should delete 

  > this file during the deployment process. Alternatively you can pass second
  parameter to restler

  > constructor to refresh the cache when changes need to be applied.


  Change Log

  ----------


  ### Restler 5


  * Semantic versioning to move forward

  * Support for PHP 8

  * Corrects the source path to be outside the vendor directory

  * Adds php development server support with `composer serve` command.

  * Ability to run the tests with `composer test` command after running the
  server 
    with `composer serve` in another window.

  ### Restler 3.0 RC6


  #### What's new


  * Adds PassThrough class to serve files outside your web root, including
  secure downloads

  * Adds Explorer class (v1 swagger 1.2 spec, and v2 swagger 2.0 spec) as a
  potential 
    replacement to Resources class (swagger 1.1 spec)
      * Explorer comes bundled with the html, css, and assets. So that you need not manually download and configure it
      * Explorer combines the parameters that are expected in the request body to create a unique model for swagger
      * Since Restler Explorer comes bundled, you can map to it to your url of choice. 
        For example `$restler->addAPIClass("Luracast/Restler/Explorer", 'swagger')` maps it to `/swagger`.
      * Explorer metadata can be easily customized with ExplorerInfo class

  #### Improvements


  * Routes class improved to provide a findAll method to list all the routes for
  a specific version of the API excluding
    the specified paths and http methods.
  * The magic properties utilized by routes when found, ignoring actual
  properties. 
    This is useful for Dynamic Model classes such as Eloquent.
  * Routes now allow `@required` and `@properties` to be arrays when the
  parameter is an object. 
    This helps us to pick and choose the properties for each api method differently.
    Example `{@properties property1,property2,property3}` `{@required property1,property2}` makes an api to only look for
    3 properties and 2 of them are required.

  * Optimized the Nav class. It now makes use of `Routes::findAll()`, along with
  Explorer class

  * Restler class has setBaseUrls method to set acceptable base urls that can be
  set using `$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']`.
    Read [this article](http://shiflett.org/blog/2006/mar/server-name-versus-http-host) to understand why. This is useful
    in the following cases when
      * PHP has trouble detecting the port correctly
      * multiple domains are pointing to the same server

  * Restler class now allows overriding the status code by setting
  `$this->restler->responseCode` from the api method.

  * Improved Forms class to send the embedded properties to emmet template. For
  example


  ```

  /**
   * {@id form1}
   *
   * @param string $name
   * @param int $age
  */

  ```

    Generates the following form

      <form role="form" id="form1" method="POST" ...

    because the emmet template has id in it (see below)

      form[role=form id=$id# name=$name# method=$method# action=$action# enctype=$enctype#]

  * Forms class uses embedded properties with `@param` comments to set html
  attributes (for example id, accept etc) easily

  * FormStyles improved.

  * Validator is now initialized by scope so that we can set its properties with
  `@class` comment. **Example:
    -**  `@class Validator {@holdException}` makes the validator to hold the exceptions instead of throwing
  * Improved Form validation with error messages for individual fields.

  * Forms example updated to show validation errors with bootstrap based themes.

  * CommentParser is now able to parse `@property`, `@property-read`,
  `@property-write` to support documenting the dynamic
    properties.
  * CommentParser supports short array syntax such as `string[]`, `DateTime[]`

  * Scope adds support for external DI Container of your choice with
  `Scope::$resolver` property.

  * Renamed `String` class to `Text` for PHP 7 support (String is a reserved
  keyword in php7)

  * Flash now implements ArrayAccess so that we can access flash variables just
  like an array

  * **composer.json**: removed many dependencies from require-dev. Will prompt
  the developers to install them individually
    when they need them.
  * newrelic support added.

  * Memcache support added.

  ## Installation


  You can add the module to your Hapi using npm:


  ```bash

  > npm install hapi-swagger --save

  ```


  **hapi-swagger** no longer bundles `joi` to fix
  [#648](https://github.com/hapi-swagger/hapi-swagger/issues/648). Install
  **hapi-swagger** with peer dependencies using:


  ```bash

  npx install-peerdeps hapi-swagger

  ```


  If you want to view the documentation from your API you will also need to
  install the `inert` and `vision` plugs-ins which support templates and static

  content serving.


  ```bash

  > npm install @hapi/inert --save

  > npm install @hapi/vision --save

  ```


  ## Documentation


  -   [Options Reference](optionsreference.md)

  -   [Usage Guide](usageguide.md)


  ## Quick start


  In your Hapi apps please check the main JavaScript file and add the following
  code to already created a Hapi `server` object.

  You will also add the routes for you API as describe on [hapi
  website](https://hapi.dev/).


  ```Javascript

  const Hapi = require('@hapi/hapi');

  const Inert = require('@hapi/inert');

  const Vision = require('@hapi/vision');

  const HapiSwagger = require('hapi-swagger');

  const Pack = require('./package');


  (async () => {
      const server = Hapi.server({
          port: 3000,
          host: 'localhost'
      });

      const swaggerOptions = {
          info: {
                  title: 'Test API Documentation',
                  version: Pack.version,
              },
          };

      await server.register([
          Inert,
          Vision,
          {
              plugin: HapiSwagger,
              options: swaggerOptions
          }
      ]);

      try {
          await server.start();
          console.log('Server running at:', server.info.uri);
      } catch(err) {
          console.log(err);
      }

      server.route(Routes);
  })();

  ```


  ### Tagging your API routes


  As a project may be a mixture of web pages and API endpoints you need to tag
  the routes you wish Swagger to

  document. Simply add the `tags: ['api']` property to the route object for any
  endpoint you want documenting.


  You can even specify more tags and then later generate tag-specific
  documentation. If you specify

  `tags: ['api', 'foo']`, you can later use `/documentation?tags=foo` to load
  the documentation on the

  HTML page (see next section).


  ```Javascript

  {
      method: 'GET',
      path: '/todo/{id}/',
      options: {
          handler: handlers.getToDo,
          description: 'Get todo',
          notes: 'Returns a todo item by the id passed in the path',
          tags: ['api'], // ADD THIS TAG
          validate: {
              params: Joi.object({
                  id : Joi.number()
                          .required()
                          .description('the id for the todo item'),
              })
          }
      },
  }

  ```


  Once you have tagged your routes start the application. **The plugin adds a
  page into your site with the route `/documentation`**,

  so the the full URL for the above options would be
  `http://localhost:3000/documentation`.


  ### Typescript


  **hapi-swagger** exports its own typescript definition file that can be used
  when registering the plugin with **Hapi**. See example below:


  #### Install Typescript Definition Files


  ```sh

  npm i @types/hapi__hapi @types/hapi__inert @types/hapi__joi
  @types/hapi__vision @types/node hapi-swagger --save-dev

  ```


  #### Register Plugin with Typescript


  ```typescript

  import * as Hapi from '@hapi/hapi';

  import * as HapiSwagger from 'hapi-swagger';


  // code omitted for brevity


  const swaggerOptions: HapiSwagger.RegisterOptions = {
      info: {
          title: 'Test API Documentation'
      }
  };


  const plugins: Array<Hapi.ServerRegisterPluginObject<any>> = [
      {
          plugin: Inert
      },
      {
          plugin: Vision
      },
      {
          plugin: HapiSwagger,
          options: swaggerOptions
      }
  ];


  await server.register(plugins);

  ```

  ## Thanks


  I would like to thank all that have contributed to the project over the last
  couple of years. This is a hard project to maintain, getting Hapi to work with
  Swagger is like putting a round plug in a square hole. Without the help of

  # octohipster [![Build
  Status](https://travis-ci.org/myfreeweb/octohipster.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/myfreeweb/octohipster)
  [![unlicense](https://img.shields.io/badge/un-license-green.svg?style=flat)](http://unlicense.org)


  Octohipster is


  - a REST library/toolkit/microframework for Clojure

  - that allows you to build HTTP APIs

  - in a declarative
  [Webmachine](https://github.com/basho/webmachine/wiki/Overview)-like style,
  using [Liberator](https://github.com/clojure-liberator/liberator)

  - powered by [Ring](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring); you can add [rate
  limiting](https://github.com/myfreeweb/ring-ratelimit),
  [authentication](https://github.com/cemerick/friend),
  [metrics](http://metrics-clojure.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ring.html), [URL
  rewriting](https://github.com/ebaxt/ring-rewrite) and more with just
  middleware


  It allows you to make APIs that


  - support hypermedia ([HAL+JSON](http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html),
  [Collection+JSON](http://amundsen.com/media-types/collection/) and
  Link/Link-Template HTTP headers; works with
  [Frenetic](http://dlindahl.github.com/frenetic/))

  - support multiple output formats (JSON, EDN, YAML and any custom format)

  - have [Swagger](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-core/wiki) documentation 

  - use [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org) for validation *and* documentation

  - have pagination


  ## Concepts


  - a **resource** is a single endpoint that accepts requests and returns
  responses

  - a **group** is a collection of resources with a single URL prefix (eg. a
  group /things contains resources /things/ and /things/{id}) and zero or more
  shared properties (usually the schema)

  - a **documenter** is a function that returns a resource which documents
  regular resources (Swagger, HAL root, etc)

  - a **mixin** is a function that is applied to multiple resources to give them
  shared behavior (eg. collection or entry behavior)

  - a **response handler** is a function that is used to encode response data to
  a particular content-type (JSON, EDN, YAML, etc.)

  - a **params handler** is a function that is used to decode incoming data from
  a particular content-type (JSON, EDN, YAML, etc.)


  ## Usage


  ```clojure

  (ns example
    (:use [octohipster core routes mixins pagination]
          [octohipster.documenters swagger schema]
          org.httpkit.server)
    (:import org.bson.types.ObjectId)
    (:require [monger.core :as mg]
              [monger.query :as mq]
              [monger.collection :as mc]
              monger.json))

  (mg/connect!)

  (mg/set-db! (mg/get-db "octohipster-example"))


  ;;;; The "model"

  ;;;;  tip: make it a separate namespace, eg. app.models.contact

  (def contact-schema
    {:id "Contact"
     :type "object"
     :properties {:name {:type "string"}
                  :phone {:type "integer"}}
     :required [:name]})

  (defn contacts-count [] (mc/count "contacts"))

  (defn contacts-all []
    (mq/with-collection "contacts"
      (mq/find {})
      (mq/skip *skip*)
      (mq/limit *limit*)))
  (defn contacts-find-by-id [x] (mc/find-map-by-id "contacts" (ObjectId. x)))

  (defn contacts-insert! [x]
    (let [id (ObjectId.)]
      (mc/insert "contacts" (assoc x :_id id))
      (mc/find-map-by-id "contacts" id)))
  (defn contacts-update! [x old] (mc/update "contacts" old x :multi false))

  (defn contacts-delete! [x] (mc/remove "contacts" x))


  ;;;; The resources

  ;; with shared pieces of documentation

  (def name-param
    {:name "name", :dataType "string", :paramType "path", :required "true", :description "The name of the contact", :allowMultiple false})

  (def body-param
    {:dataType "Contact", :paramType "body", :required true, :allowMultiple false})

  (defresource contact-collection
    :desc "Operations with multiple contacts"
    :mixins [collection-resource]
    :clinks {:item ::contact-item}
    :data-key :contacts
    :exists? (fn [ctx] {:contacts (contacts-all)})
    :post! (fn [ctx] {:item (-> ctx :request :non-query-params contacts-insert!)})
    :count (fn [req] (contacts-count))
    :doc {:get {:nickname "getContacts", :summary "Get all contacts"}
          :post {:nickname "createContact", :summary "Create a contact"}})

  (defresource contact-item
    :desc "Operations with individual contacts"
    :url "/{_id}"
    :mixins [item-resource]
    :clinks {:collection ::contact-collection}
    :data-key :contact
    :exists? (fn [ctx]
               (if-let [doc (-> ctx :request :route-params :_id contacts-find-by-id)]
                 {:contact doc}))
    :put! (fn [ctx]
            (-> ctx :request :non-query-params (contacts-update! (:contact ctx)))
            {:contact (-> ctx :request :route-params :_id contacts-find-by-id)})
    :delete! (fn [ctx]
               (-> ctx :contact contacts-delete!)
               {:contact nil})
    :doc {:get {:nickname "getContact", :summary "Get a contact", :parameters [name-param]}
          :put {:nickname "updateContact", :summary "Overwrite a contact", :parameters [name-param body-param]}
          :delete {:nickname "deleteContact", :summary "Delete a contact", :parameters [name-param]}})

  ;;;; The group

  (defgroup contact-group
    :url "/contacts"
    :add-to-resources {:schema contact-schema}  ; instead of typing the same for all resources in the group
    :resources [contact-collection contact-item])

  ;;;; The handler

  (defroutes site
    :groups [contact-group]
    :documenters [schema-doc schema-root-doc swagger-doc swagger-root-doc])

  (defn -main [] (run-server site {:port 8080}))

  ```


  Also, [API Documentation](http://myfreeweb.github.com/octohipster) is
  available.

DarthFubuMVC/fubumvc: "# Building FubuMVC\r\n\r\nThe FubuMVC codebase still uses Rake for build automation, but as of September 2015, you don't **have** to use Rake to develop with FubuMVC if you don't want to. You **will need \r\nto have Node.js or Io.js and npm installed** in order to build the client side assets for FubuMVC's diagnostics package before working with the C# code.\r\n\r\n## With Rake\r\n\r\nAssuming you have Ruby 2.1+ installed on your computer, go to a command line and type...\r\n\r\n1. bundle install\r\n1. rake\r\n\r\n\r\n## Visual Studio.Net Only\r\n\r\nThere is a small command file called `build.cmd` that can be executed once to bring down nuget and npm dependencies and build the client side assets that FubuMVC \r\nneeds for its embedded. diagnostics. Run this command at least once before opening Visual Studio.Net.\r\n\r\nFrom there, open the solution file at `src/FubuMVC.sln` and go to town.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Working with Storyteller\r\n\r\n* `rake open_st` -- Opens the Storyteller test suite in the Storyteller client for interactive editing and execution\r\n* `rake storyteller` -- Runs all the Storyteller specifications\r\n\r\n# Working with Diagnostics\r\n\r\nOpen the diagnostics harness application to the browser with the command `rake diagnostics`. This command will start webpack in a new window against the client side\r\nattributes in the `javascript` folder in \"watched\" mode. This command also compiles and starts the `DiagnosticsHarness` application in a NOWIN server before opening a browser\r\nwindow to the newly launched application. The browser will auto-refresh whenever a new version of the webpack `bundle.js` file is saved. You will have to stop and restart\r\nthe FubuMVC application to see any changes to the server side.\r\n \r\n\r\n"

  | :mega: Calling for Maintainers |

  |--------------|

  | With the introduction of [ASP.NET Core](https://www.asp.net/core), I've now
  shifted my focus to the Core-specific project -
  [Swashbuckle.AspNetCore](https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle.AspNetCore).
  That will be receiving most of my (already limited) personal time, and so I
  won't have the capacity to maintain this one at a sufficient rate. Still, I'd
  love to see it live on and am seeking one or two "core" contributors /
  maintainers to help out. Ideally, these would be people who have already
  contributed through PRs and understand the inner workings and overall design.
  Once signed-up, we can agree on an approach that works - ultimately, I want to
  remove myself as the bottleneck to merging PRs and getting fresh Nugets
  published. If you're interested, please let me know by adding a comment
  [here](https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle/issues/1053) |


  Swashbuckle

  =========


  [![Build
  status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/qoesh4nm6tb6diuk?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/domaindrivendev/swashbuckle)


  Seamlessly adds a [Swagger](http://swagger.io/) to WebApi projects! Combines
  ApiExplorer and Swagger/swagger-ui to provide a rich discovery, documentation
  and playground experience to your API consumers.


  In addition to its Swagger generator, Swashbuckle also contains an embedded
  version of [swagger-ui](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui) which it
  will automatically serve up once Swashbuckle is installed. This means you can
  complement your API with a slick discovery UI to assist consumers with their
  integration efforts. Best of all, it requires minimal coding and maintenance,
  allowing you to focus on building an awesome API!


  And that's not all ...


  Once you have a Web API that can describe itself in Swagger, you've opened the
  treasure chest of Swagger-based tools including a client generator that can be
  targeted to a wide range of popular platforms. See
  [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) for more
  details.


  **Swashbuckle Core Features:**


  * Auto-generated [Swagger
  2.0](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md)

  * Seamless integration of swagger-ui

  * Reflection-based Schema generation for describing API types

  * Extensibility hooks for customizing the generated Swagger doc

  * Extensibility hooks for customizing the swagger-ui

  * Out-of-the-box support for leveraging Xml comments

  * Support for describing ApiKey, Basic Auth and OAuth2 schemes ... including
  UI support for the Implicit OAuth2 flow


  **Swashbuckle 5.0**


  Swashbuckle 5.0 makes the transition to Swagger 2.0. The 2.0 schema is
  significantly different to its predecessor (1.2) and, as a result, the
  Swashbuckle config interface has undergone yet another overhaul. Checkout the
  [transition guide](#transitioning-to-swashbuckle-50) if you're upgrading from
  a prior version.


  ## Getting Started ##


  There are currently two Nuget packages - the Core library (Swashbuckle.Core)
  and a convenience package (Swashbuckle)  - that provides automatic
  bootstrapping. The latter is only applicable to regular IIS hosted Web APIs.
  For all other hosting environments, you should only install the Core library
  and then follow the instructions below to manually enable the Swagger routes.


  Once installed and enabled, you should be able to browse the following Swagger
  docs and UI endpoints respectively:


  ***\<your-root-url\>/swagger/docs/v1***


  ***\<your-root-url\>/swagger***


  ### IIS Hosted ###


  If your service is hosted in IIS, you can start exposing Swagger docs and a
  corresponding swagger-ui by simply installing the following Nuget package:

      Install-Package Swashbuckle

  This will add a reference to Swashbuckle.Core and also install a bootstrapper
  (App_Start/SwaggerConfig.cs) that enables the Swagger routes on app start-up
  using [WebActivatorEx](https://github.com/davidebbo/WebActivator).


  ### Self-hosted ###


  If your service is self-hosted, just install the Core library:

      Install-Package Swashbuckle.Core

  Then manually enable the Swagger docs and, optionally, the swagger-ui by
  invoking the following extension methods (in namespace
  Swashbuckle.Application) on an instance of HttpConfiguration (e.g. in
  Program.cs)


  ```csharp

  httpConfiguration
       .EnableSwagger(c => c.SingleApiVersion("v1", "A title for your API"))
       .EnableSwaggerUi();
  ```


  ### OWIN  ###


  If your service is hosted using OWIN middleware, just install the Core
  library:

      Install-Package Swashbuckle.Core

  Then manually enable the Swagger docs and swagger-ui by invoking the extension
  methods (in namespace Swashbuckle.Application) on an instance of
  HttpConfiguration (e.g. in Startup.cs)


  ```csharp

  httpConfiguration
      .EnableSwagger(c => c.SingleApiVersion("v1", "A title for your API"))
      .EnableSwaggerUi();    
  ```


  ## Troubleshooting ##


  Troubleshooting??? I thought this was all supposed to be "seamless"? OK you've
  called me out! Things shouldn't go wrong, but if they do, take a look at the
  [FAQs](#troubleshooting-and-faqs) for inspiration.


  ## Customizing the Generated Swagger Docs ##


  The following snippet demonstrates the minimum configuration required to get
  the Swagger docs and swagger-ui up and running:

  ```csharp

  httpConfiguration
        .EnableSwagger(c => c.SingleApiVersion("v1", "A title for your API"))
        .EnableSwaggerUi();
  ```


  These methods expose a range of configuration and extensibility options that
  you can pick and choose from, combining the convenience of sensible defaults
  with the flexibility to customize where you see fit. Read on to learn more.


  ### Custom Routes ###


  The default route templates for the Swagger docs and swagger-ui are
  "swagger/docs/{apiVersion}" and "swagger/ui/{\*assetPath}" respectively.
  You're free to change these so long as the provided templates include the
  relevant route parameters - {apiVersion} and {\*assetPath}.


  ```csharp

  httpConfiguration
      .EnableSwagger("docs/{apiVersion}/swagger", c => c.SingleApiVersion("v1", "A title for your API"))
      .EnableSwaggerUi("sandbox/{*assetPath}");
  ```


  In this case the URL to swagger-ui will be `sandbox/index`.


  ### Pretty Print ###


  If you want the output Swagger docs to be indented properly, enable the
  __PrettyPrint__ option as following:


  ```cs

  httpConfiguration
      .EnableSwagger(c => c.PrettyPrint())
      .EnableSwaggerUi();
  ```


  ### Additional Service Metadata ###


  In addition to operation descriptions, Swagger 2.0 includes several properties
  to describe the service itself. These can all be provided through the
  configuration API:


  ```csharp

  httpConfiguration
      .EnableSwagger(c =>
          {
              c.RootUrl(req => GetRootUrlFromAppConfig());

              c.Schemes(new[] { "http", "https" });

              c.SingleApiVersion("v1", "Swashbuckle.Dummy")
                  .Description("A sample API for testing and prototyping Swashbuckle features")
                  .TermsOfService("Some terms")
                  .Contact(cc => cc
                      .Name("Some contact")
                      .Url("http://tempuri.org/contact")
                      .Email("some.contact@tempuri.org"))
                  .License(lc => lc
                      .Name("Some License")
                      .Url("http://tempuri.org/license"));
          });
  ```

  #### RootUrl ####


  By default, the service root url is inferred from the request used to access
  the docs. However, there may be situations (e.g. proxy and load-balanced
  environments) where this does not resolve correctly. You can workaround this
  by providing your own code to determine the root URL.


  #### Schemes ####


  If schemes are not explicitly provided in a Swagger 2.0 document, then the
  scheme used to access the docs is taken as the default. If your API supports
  multiple schemes and you want to be explicit about them, you can use the
  __Schemes__ option.


  #### SingleApiVersion ####


  Use this to describe a single version API. Swagger 2.0 includes an "Info"
  object to hold additional metadata for an API. Version and title are required
  but you may also provide additional fields as shown above.


  __NOTE__: If your Web API is hosted in IIS, you should avoid using full-stops
  in the version name (e.g. "1.0"). The full-stop at the tail of the URL will
  cause IIS to treat it as a static file (i.e. with an extension) and bypass the
  URL Routing Module and therefore, Web API. 


  ### Describing Multiple API Versions ###


  If your API has multiple versions, use __MultipleApiVersions__ instead of
  __SingleApiVersion__. In this case, you provide a lambda that tells
  Swashbuckle which actions should be included in the docs for a given API
  version. Like __SingleApiVersion__, __Version__ also returns an "Info" builder
  so you can provide additional metadata per API version.


  ```csharp

  httpConfiguration
      .EnableSwagger(c =>
          {
              c.MultipleApiVersions(
                  (apiDesc, targetApiVersion) => ResolveVersionSupportByRouteConstraint(apiDesc, targetApiVersion),
                  (vc) =>
                  {
                      vc.Version("v2", "Swashbuckle Dummy API V2");
                      vc.Version("v1", "Swashbuckle Dummy API V1");
                  });
          });
      .EnableSwaggerUi(c =>
          {
              c.EnableDiscoveryUrlSelector();
          });
  ```


  \* You can also enable a select box in the swagger-ui (as shown above) that
  displays a discovery URL for each version. This provides a convenient way for
  users to browse documentation for different API versions.


  ### Describing Security/Authorization Schemes ###


  You can use BasicAuth, __ApiKey__ or __OAuth2__ options to describe security
  schemes for the API. See
  https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md for
  more details.


  ```csharp

  httpConfiguration
       .EnableSwagger(c =>
           {
               //c.BasicAuth("basic")
               //    .Description("Basic HTTP Authentication");

               //c.ApiKey("apiKey")
               //    .Description("API Key Authentication")
               //    .Name("apiKey")
               //    .In("header");

               c.OAuth2("oauth2")
                   .Description("OAuth2 Implicit Grant")
                   .Flow("implicit")
                   .AuthorizationUrl("http://petstore.swagger.wordnik.com/api/oauth/dialog")
                   //.TokenUrl("https://tempuri.org/token")
                   .Scopes(scopes =>
                   {
                       scopes.Add("read", "Read access to protected resources");
                       scopes.Add("write", "Write access to protected resources");
                   });

               c.OperationFilter<AssignOAuth2SecurityRequirements>();
           });
       .EnableSwaggerUi(c =>
           {
               c.EnableOAuth2Support("test-client-id", "test-realm", "Swagger UI");
           });
  ```

  __NOTE:__ These only define the schemes and need to be coupled with a
  corresponding "security" property at the document or operation level to
  indicate which schemes are required for each operation.  To do this, you'll
  need to implement a custom IDocumentFilter and/or IOperationFilter to set
  these properties according to your specific authorization implementation


  \* If your API supports the OAuth2 Implicit flow, and you've described it
  correctly, according to the Swagger 2.0 specification, you can enable UI
  support as shown above.


  ### Customize the Operation Listing ###


  If necessary, you can ignore obsolete actions and provide custom
  grouping/sorting strategies for the list of Operations in a Swagger document:


  ```csharp

  httpConfiguration
      .EnableSwagger(c =>
          {
              c.IgnoreObsoleteActions();

              c.GroupActionsBy(apiDesc => apiDesc.HttpMethod.ToString());

              c.OrderActionGroupsBy(new DescendingAlphabeticComparer());
          });
  ```

  #### IgnoreObsoleteActions ####


  Set this flag to omit operation descriptions for any actions decorated with
  the Obsolete attribute


  __NOTE__: If you want to omit specific operations but without using the
  Obsolete attribute, you can create an IDocumentFilter or make use of the built
  in ApiExplorerSettingsAttribute


  #### GroupActionsBy ####


  Each operation can be assigned one or more tags which are then used by
  consumers for various reasons. For example, the swagger-ui groups operations
  according to the first tag of each operation. By default, this will be the
  controller name but you can use this method to override with any value.


  #### OrderActionGroupsBy ####


  You can also specify a custom sort order for groups (as defined by
  __GroupActionsBy__) to dictate the order in which operations are listed. For
  example, if the default grouping is in place (controller name) and you specify
  a descending alphabetic sort order, then actions from a ProductsController
  will be listed before those from a CustomersController. This is typically used
  to customize the order of groupings in the swagger-ui.


  ### Modifying Generated Schemas ###


  Swashbuckle makes a best attempt at generating Swagger compliant JSON schemas
  for the various types exposed in your API. However, there may be occasions
  when more control of the output is needed.  This is supported through the
  following options:


  ```csharp

  httpConfiguration
        .EnableSwagger(c =>
            {
                c.MapType<ProductType>(() => new Schema { type = "integer", format = "int32" });

                c.SchemaFilter<ApplySchemaVendorExtensions>();

                //c.UseFullTypeNameInSchemaIds();

                c.SchemaId(t => t.FullName.Contains('`') ? t.FullName.Substring(0, t.FullName.IndexOf('`')) : t.FullName);
                
                c.IgnoreObsoleteProperties();

                c.DescribeAllEnumsAsStrings();
            });
  ```


  #### MapType ####


  Use this option to override the Schema generation for a specific type.


  It should be noted that the resulting Schema will be placed "inline" for any
  applicable Operations. While Swagger 2.0 supports inline definitions for "all"
  Schema types, the swagger-ui tool does not. It expects "complex" Schemas to be
  defined separately and referenced. For this reason, you should only use the
  __MapType__ option when the resulting Schema is a primitive or array type.


  If you need to alter a complex Schema, use a Schema filter.


  #### SchemaFilter ####


  If you want to post-modify "complex" Schemas once they've been generated,
  across the board or for a specific type, you can wire up one or more Schema
  filters.


  ISchemaFilter has the following interface:


  ```csharp

  void Apply(Schema schema, SchemaRegistry schemaRegistry, Type type);

  ```


  A typical implementation will inspect the system Type and modify the Schema
  accordingly. If necessary, the schemaRegistry can be used to obtain or
  register Schemas for other Types


  #### UseFullTypeNamesInSchemaIds ####


  In a Swagger 2.0 document, complex types are typically declared globally and
  referenced by unique Schema Id. By default, Swashbuckle does NOT use the full
  type name in Schema Ids. In most cases, this works well because it prevents
  the "implementation detail" of type namespaces from leaking into your Swagger
  docs and UI. However, if you have multiple types in your API with the same
  class name, you'll need to opt out of this behavior to avoid Schema Id
  conflicts.  


  #### SchemaId ####


  Use this option to provide your own custom strategy for inferring SchemaId's
  for describing "complex" types in your API.


  #### IgnoreObsoleteProperties ####


  Set this flag to omit schema property descriptions for any type properties
  decorated with the Obsolete attribute 


  #### DescribeAllEnumsAsStrings ####


  In accordance with the built in JsonSerializer, Swashbuckle will, by default,
  describe enums as integers. You can change the serializer behavior by
  configuring the StringEnumConverter globally or for a given enum type.
  Swashbuckle will honor this change out-of-the-box. However, if you use a
  different approach to serialize enums as strings, you can also force
  Swashbuckle to describe them as strings.


  ### Modifying Generated Operations ###


  Similar to Schema filters, Swashbuckle also supports Operation and Document
  filters:


  ```csharp

  httpConfiguration
       .EnableSwagger(c => c.SingleApiVersion("v1", "A title for your API"))
           {
               c.OperationFilter<AddDefaultResponse>();

               c.DocumentFilter<ApplyDocumentVendorExtensions>();
           });
  ```

  #### OperationFilter ####


  Post-modify Operation descriptions once they've been generated by wiring up
  one or more Operation filters.


  IOperationFilter has the following interface:


  ```csharp

  void Apply(Operation operation, SchemaRegistry schemaRegistry, ApiDescription
  apiDescription);

  ```


  A typical implementation will inspect the ApiDescription and modify the
  Operation accordingly. If necessary, the schemaRegistry can be used to obtain
  or register Schemas for Types that are used in the Operation.


  #### DocumentFilter ####


  Post-modify the entire Swagger document by wiring up one or more Document
  filters.


  IDocumentFilter has the following interface:


  ```csharp

  void Apply(SwaggerDocument swaggerDoc, SchemaRegistry schemaRegistry,
  IApiExplorer apiExplorer);

  ```


  This gives full control to modify the final SwaggerDocument. You can gain
  additional context from the provided SwaggerDocument (e.g. version) and
  IApiExplorer. You should have a good understanding of the [Swagger 2.0
  spec.](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md)
  before using this option.


  ### Wrapping the SwaggerGenerator with Additional Behavior ###


  The default implementation of ISwaggerProvider, the interface used to obtain
  Swagger metadata for a given API, is the SwaggerGenerator. If neccessary, you
  can inject your own implementation or wrap the existing one with additional
  behavior. For example, you could use this option to inject a "Caching Proxy"
  that attempts to retrieve the SwaggerDocument from a cache before delegating
  to the built-in generator:


  ```csharp

  httpConfiguration
        .EnableSwagger(c => c.SingleApiVersion("v1", "A title for your API"))
            {
          c.CustomProvider((defaultProvider) => new CachingSwaggerProvider(defaultProvider));
            });
  ```


  ### Including XML Comments ###


  If you annotate Controllers and API Types with [Xml
  Comments](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/b2s063f7(v=vs.110).aspx),
  you can incorporate those comments into the generated docs and UI. The Xml
  tags are mapped to Swagger properties as follows:


  * **Action summary** -> Operation.summary

  * **Action remarks** -> Operation.description

  * **Parameter summary** -> Parameter.description

  * **Type summary** -> Schema.descripton

  * **Property summary** -> Schema.description (i.e. on a property Schema)


  You can enable this by providing the path to one or more XML comments files:

  ```csharp

  httpConfiguration
      .EnableSwagger(c =>
          {
              c.SingleApiVersion("v1", "A title for your API");
              c.IncludeXmlComments(GetXmlCommentsPathForControllers());
              c.IncludeXmlComments(GetXmlCommentsPathForModels());
          });
  ```


  NOTE: You will need to enable output of the XML documentation file. This is
  enabled by going to project properties -> Build -> Output. The "XML
  documentation file" needs to be checked and a path assigned, such as
  "bin\Debug\MyProj.XML". You will also want to verify this across each build
  configuration. Here's an example of reading the file, but it may need to be
  modified according to your specific project settings:


  ```csharp

  httpConfiguration
      .EnableSwagger(c =>
          {
              var baseDirectory = AppDomain.CurrentDomain.BaseDirectory;
              var commentsFileName = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().GetName().Name + ".XML";
              var commentsFile = Path.Combine(baseDirectory, commentsFileName);

              c.SingleApiVersion("v1", "A title for your API");
              c.IncludeXmlComments(commentsFile);
              c.IncludeXmlComments(GetXmlCommentsPathForModels());
          });
  ```

  #### Response Codes ####


  Swashbuckle will automatically create a "success" response for each operation
  based on the action's return type. If it's a void, the status code will be 204
  (No content), otherwise 200 (Ok). This mirrors WebApi's default behavior. If
  you need to change this and/or list additional response codes, you can use the
  non-standard "response" tag:


  ```csharp

  /// <response code="201">Account created</response>

  /// <response code="400">Username already in use</response>

  public int Create(Account account)

  ```

  ### Working Around Swagger 2.0 Constraints ###


  In contrast to Web API, Swagger 2.0 does not include the query string
  component when mapping a URL to an action. As a result, Swashbuckle will raise
  an exception if it encounters multiple actions with the same path (sans query
  string) and HTTP method. You can workaround this by providing a custom
  strategy to pick a winner or merge the descriptions for the purposes of the
  Swagger docs 


  ```csharp

  httpConfiguration
      .EnableSwagger((c) =>
          {
              c.SingleApiVersion("v1", "A title for your API"));
              c.ResolveConflictingActions(apiDescriptions => apiDescriptions.First());
          });
  ```

  See the following discussion for more details:


  <https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle/issues/142>


  ## Customizing the swagger-ui ##


  The swagger-ui is a JavaScript application hosted in a single HTML page
  (index.html), and it exposes several customization settings. Swashbuckle ships
  with an embedded version and includes corresponding configuration methods for
  each of the UI settings. If you require further customization, you can also
  inject your own version of "index.html". Read on to learn more.


  ### Customizations via the configuration API ###


  If you're happy with the basic look and feel but want to make some minor
  tweaks, the following options may be sufficient:


  ```csharp

  httpConfiguration
      .EnableSwagger(c => c.SingleApiVersion("v1", "A title for your API"))
      .EnableSwaggerUi(c =>
          {
              c.InjectStylesheet(containingAssembly, "Swashbuckle.Dummy.SwaggerExtensions.testStyles1.css");
              c.InjectJavaScript(containingAssembly, "Swashbuckle.Dummy.SwaggerExtensions.testScript1.js");
              c.SetValidatorUrl("http://localhost/validator");
              c.DisableValidator();
              c.DocExpansion(DocExpansion.List);
              c.SupportedSubmitMethods("GET", "HEAD")
          });
  ```


  #### InjectStylesheet ####


  Use this to enrich the UI with one or more additional CSS stylesheets. The
  file(s) must be included in your project as an "Embedded Resource", and then
  the resource's "Logical Name" is passed to the method as shown above. See
  [Injecting Custom Content](#injecting-custom-content) for step by step
  instructions.


  #### InjectJavaScript ####


  Use this to invoke one or more custom JavaScripts after the swagger-ui has
  loaded. The file(s) must be included in your project as an "Embedded
  Resource", and then the resource's "Logical Name" is passed to the method as
  shown above. See [Injecting Custom Content](#injecting-custom-content) for
  step by step instructions.


  #### SetValidatorUrl/DisableValidator ####


  By default, swagger-ui will validate specs against swagger.io's online
  validator and display the result in a badge at the bottom of the page. Use
  these options to set a different validator URL or to disable the feature
  entirely.


  #### DocExpansion ####


  Use this option to control how the Operation listing is displayed. It can be
  set to "None" (default), "List" (shows operations for each resource), or
  "Full" (fully expanded: shows operations and their details).


  #### SupportedSubmitMethods ####


  Specify which HTTP operations will have the 'Try it out!' option. An empty
  parameter list disables it for all operations.


  ### Provide your own "index" file ###


  As an alternative, you can inject your own version of "index.html" and
  customize the markup and swagger-ui directly. Use the __CustomAsset__ option
  to instruct Swashbuckle to return your version instead of the default when a
  request is made for "index". As with all custom content, the file must be
  included in your project as an "Embedded Resource", and then the resource's
  "Logical Name" is passed to the method as shown below. See [Injecting Custom
  Content](#injecting-custom-content) for step by step instructions.


  For compatibility, you should base your custom "index.html" off [this
  version](https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle/blob/v5.5.3/Swashbuckle.Core/SwaggerUi/CustomAssets/index.html)


  ```csharp

  httpConfiguration
       .EnableSwagger(c => c.SingleApiVersion("v1", "A title for your API"))
       .EnableSwaggerUi(c =>
           {
               c.CustomAsset("index", yourAssembly, "YourWebApiProject.SwaggerExtensions.index.html");
           });
  ```


  ### Injecting Custom Content ###


  The __InjectStylesheet__, __InjectJavaScript__ and __CustomAsset__ options all
  share the same mechanism for providing custom content. In each case, the file
  must be included in your project as an "Embedded Resource". The steps to do
  this are described below:


  1. Add a new file to your Web API project.

  2. In Solution Explorer, right click the file and open its properties window.
  Change the "Build Action" to "Embedded Resource".


  This will embed the file in your assembly and register it with a "Logical
  Name". This can then be passed to the relevant configuration method. It's
  based on the Project's default namespace, file location and file extension.
  For example, given a default namespace of "YourWebApiProject" and a file
  located at "/SwaggerExtensions/index.html", then the resource will be assigned
  the name - "YourWebApiProject.SwaggerExtensions.index.html". If you use
  "Swagger" as the root folder name for your custom assets, this will collide
  with the default route templates and the page will not be loaded correctly.


  ## Transitioning to Swashbuckle 5.0 ##


  This version of Swashbuckle makes the transition to Swagger 2.0. The 2.0
  specification is significantly different to its predecessor (1.2) and forces
  several breaking changes to Swashbuckle's configuration API. If you're using
  Swashbuckle without any customizations, i.e. App_Start/SwaggerConfig.cs has
  never been modified, then you can overwrite it with the new version. The
  defaults are the same and so the swagger-ui should behave as before.


  \* If you have consumers of the raw Swagger document, you should ensure they
  can accept Swagger 2.0 before making the upgrade.


  If you're using the existing configuration API to customize the final Swagger
  document and/or swagger-ui, you will need to port the code manually. The
  static __Customize__ methods on SwaggerSpecConfig and SwaggerUiConfig have
  been replaced with extension methods on HttpConfiguration - __EnableSwagger__
  and __EnableSwaggerUi__. All options from version 4.0 are made available
  through these methods, albeit with slightly different naming and syntax. Refer
  to the tables below for a summary of changes:



  | 4.0 | 5.0 Equivalent | Additional Notes |

  | --------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |

  | ResolveBasePathUsing | RootUrl | |

  | ResolveTargetVersionUsing | N/A | version is now implicit in the docs URL
  e.g. "swagger/docs/{apiVersion}" |

  | ApiVersion | SingleApiVersion| now supports additional metadata for the
  version | 

  | SupportMultipleApiVersions | MultipleApiVersions | now supports additional
  metadata for each version |

  | Authorization | BasicAuth/ApiKey/OAuth2 | | 

  | GroupDeclarationsBy | GroupActionsBy | |

  | SortDeclarationsBy | OrderActionGroupsBy | |

  | MapType | MapType | now accepts Func&lt;Schema&gt; instead of
  Func&lt;DataType&gt; |

  | ModelFilter | SchemaFilter | IModelFilter is now ISchemaFilter,
  DataTypeRegistry is now SchemaRegistry |

  | OperationFilter | OperationFilter | DataTypeRegistry is now SchemaRegistry |

  | PolymorphicType | N/A | not currently supported |

  | SupportHeaderParams | N/A | header params are implicitly supported |

  | SupportedSubmitMethods | N/A | all HTTP verbs are implicitly supported |

  | CustomRoute | CustomAsset | &nbsp; |

  ### Swagger-ui showing "Can't read swagger JSON from ..."


  If you see this message, it means the swagger-ui received an unexpected
  response when requesting the Swagger document. You can troubleshoot further by
  navigating directly to the discovery URL included in the error message. This
  should provide more details.


  If the discovery URL returns a 404 Not Found response, it may be due to a
  full-stop in the version name (e.g. "1.0"). This will cause IIS to treat it as
  a static file (i.e. with an extension) and bypass the URL Routing Module and
  therefore, Web API. 


  To workaround, you can update the version name specified in SwaggerConfig.cs.
  For example, to "v1", "1-0" etc. Alternatively, you can change the route
  template being used for the swagger docs (as shown [here](#custom-routes)) so
  that the version parameter is not at the end of the route.


  ### Page not found when accessing the UI ###


  Swashbuckle serves an embedded version of the swagger-ui through the Web API
  pipeline. But, most of the URLs contain extensions (.html, .js, .css) and many
  IIS environments are configured to bypass the managed pipeline for paths
  containing extensions.


  In previous versions of Swashbuckle, this was resolved by adding the following
  setting to your Web.config:


  ```xml

  <system.webServer>
    <modules runAllManagedModulesForAllRequests="true" />
  </system.webServer>

  ```


  This is no longer neccessary in Swashbuckle 5.0 because it serves the
  swagger-ui through extensionless URL's.


  However, if you're using the SingleApiVersion, MultipleApiVersions or
  CustomAsset configuration settings you could still get this error. Check to
  ensure you're not specifying a value that causes a URL with an extension to be
  referenced in the UI. For example a full-stop in a version number ...


  ```csharp

  httpConfiguration
      .EnableSwagger(c => c.SingleApiVersion("1.0", "A title for your API"))
      .EnableSwaggerUi();
  ```

  will result in a discovery URL like this "/swagger/docs/1.0" where the
  full-stop is treated as a file extension.


  ### Swagger-ui broken by Visual Studio 2013 ###


  VS 2013 ships with a new feature - Browser Link - that improves the web
  development workflow by setting up a channel between the IDE and pages being
  previewed in a local browser. It does this by dynamically injecting JavaScript
  into your files.


  Although this JavaScript SHOULD have no affect on your production code, it
  appears to be breaking the swagger-ui.


  I hope to find a permanent fix, but in the meantime, you'll need to workaround
  this issue by disabling the feature in your web.config:


  ```xml

  <appSettings>
      <add key="vs:EnableBrowserLink" value="false"/>
  </appSettings>

  ```

  ### OWIN Hosted in IIS - Incorrect VirtualPathRoot Handling


  When you host Web API 2 on top of OWIN/SystemWeb, Swashbuckle cannot correctly
  resolve VirtualPathRoot by default.


  You must either explicitly set VirtualPathRoot in your HttpConfiguration at
  startup, or perform customization like this to fix automatic discovery:


  ```csharp

  httpConfiguration.EnableSwagger(c => 

  {
      c.RootUrl(req =>
          req.RequestUri.GetLeftPart(UriPartial.Authority) +
          req.GetRequestContext().VirtualPathRoot.TrimEnd('/'));
  }

  ```


  ### How to add vendor extensions


  Swagger 2.0 allows additional meta-data (aka vendor extensions) to be added at
  various points in the Swagger document. Swashbuckle supports this by including
  a "vendorExtensions" dictionary with each of the extensible Swagger types.
  Meta-data can be added to these dictionaries from custom Schema, Operation or
  Document filters. For example:


  ```csharp

  public class ApplySchemaVendorExtensions : ISchemaFilter

  {
      public void Apply(Schema schema, SchemaRegistry schemaRegistry, Type type)
      {
          schema.vendorExtensions.Add("x-foo", "bar");
      }
  }

  ```


  As per the specification, all extension properties should be prefixed by "x-"


  ### FromUri Query string DataMember names are incorrect


  When using `FromUri` Model Binding, it is possible to override the querystring
  parameter name's using `DataMember`s. In this case you can add a custom
  operation filter to override the name. For example:


  ```csharp

  public class ComplexTypeOperationFilter : IOperationFilter

  {
      public void Apply(Operation operation, SchemaRegistry schemaRegistry, ApiDescription apiDescription)
      {
          if (operation.parameters == null)
              return;

          var parameters = apiDescription.ActionDescriptor.GetParameters();
          foreach (var parameter in parameters)
          {
              foreach (var property in parameter.ParameterType.GetProperties())
              {
                  var param = operation.parameters.FirstOrDefault(o => o.name.ToLowerInvariant().Contains(property.Name.ToLowerInvariant()));

                  if (param == null) continue;

                  var name = GetNameFromAttribute(property);

                  if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(name))
                  {
                      operation.parameters.Remove(param);
                  }
                  param.name = GetNameFromAttribute(property);
              }
          }
      }
      
      private static string GetNameFromAttribute(PropertyInfo property)
      {
          var customAttributes = property.GetCustomAttributes(typeof(DataMemberAttribute), true);
          if (customAttributes.Length > 0)
          {
              var attribute = customAttributes[0] as DataMemberAttribute;
              if (attribute != null) return attribute.Name;
          }
          return string.Empty;
      }
  }

  ```


  ### Remove Duplicate Path Parameters


  When using `FromUri` Model Binding, duplicate items can appear as items can be
  passed as URI parameters, or querystrings. In this case you can add a custom
  operation filter to remove the duplicates. For example:


  ```csharp

  public class ComplexTypeOperationFilter : IOperationFilter

  {
      public void Apply(Operation operation, SchemaRegistry schemaRegistry, ApiDescription apiDescription)
      {
         if (operation.parameters == null)
             return;
         var complexParameters = operation.parameters.Where(x => x.@in == "query" && !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(x.name)).ToArray();

         foreach (var parameter in complexParameters)
         {
             if (!parameter.name.Contains('.')) continue;
             var name = parameter.name.Split('.')[1];

             var opParams = operation.parameters.Where(x => x.name == name);
             var parameters = opParams as Parameter[] ?? opParams.ToArray();

             if (parameters.Length > 0)
             {
                 operation.parameters.Remove(parameter);
             }
         }
      }
  }

  ```


  ### Deploying behind Load Balancer / Reverse Proxies


  Swashbuckle attempts to populate the [Swagger
  "host"](http://swagger.io/specification/#swaggerObject) property from HTTP
  headers that are sent with the request for Swagger JSON. This may cause issues
  in load balancer / reverse proxy environments, particularly if non-standard
  headers are used to pass on the outer most host name. You can workaround this
  by providing your own function for determining your API's root URL based on
  vendor-specific headers. Checkout [issue
  705](https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle/issues/705) for some
  potential implementations.


  ### 500 : {"Message":"An error has occurred."}


  If, on loading the Swagger UI page, you get an error: `500 : {"Message":"An
  error has occurred."} http://<url>/swagger/docs/v1` ensure that the XML
  documentation output settings have been set in the project file in the
  solution, for both Debug and Release configurations.

  # New! AutoRest Version 3.0 

  AutoRest 3.0 introduces a large number of internal changes to support new
  scenarios. 


  ## Features


  ### OpenAPI3 support! 

  AutoRest 3.0 finally supports OpenAPI3 files as an input format, with the
  following caveats:

  - existing AutoRest v2 generators may not support all features from OpenAPI3.
  (see next section)

  - `anyOf`, `oneOf` are not currently supported 

  - other OpenAPI3 specific features may not be entirely supported.


  ### Generators


  A new set of language generator plugins are being written that adopt the
  lighter-weight patterns for Azure Core libraries.<br>

  Existing V2 generators will default to processing with the AutoRest 2
  pipeline. <br>

  If you want to force it to use the v3 (to get support for OpenAPI3 ) add
  `--v3` to the command line:

  > `autorest --v3 --csharp ...`


  | Generator | Command | Notes |

  |----|---|---|

  |PowerShell| `autorest --powershell ...` |Fully V3 Supported - use to generate
  powershell modules |   

  |CSharp|`autorest --csharp ...` |v2 generator, may use OpenAPI3 with `--v3`
  switch (may be some differences) - v3 generator in progress | 

  |Python|`autorest --python ...` |v2 generator, may use OpenAPI3 with `--v3`
  switch (may be some differences) - v3 generator in progress| 

  |Java|`autorest --java ...` |v2 generator, may use OpenAPI3 with `--v3` switch
  (may be some differences) - v3 generator in progress | 

  |TypeScript|`autorest --typescript ...` |v2 generator, may use OpenAPI3 with
  `--v3` switch (may be some differences) - v3 generator in progress | 

  |Go|`autorest --go ...` |v2 generator, may use OpenAPI3 with `--v3` switch
  (may be some differences) - v3 generator in progress | 

  |Ruby|`autorest --ruby ...` |v2 generator - does not support v3 feature, no
  OpenAPI3 support | 


  #### New V3 Pipeline


  In AutoRest v3, the pipeline has been drastically rebuilt, which allows
  support for:

  - OpenAPI3 inputs

  - Supporting merging multiple API versions 

  - Model Deduplication and Subset reduction across multiple API versions

  - Azure Profile support (v3 generator required)


  Some related information:

  - [Validation Rules &
  Linting](https://github.com/Azure/azure-openapi-validator/blob/master/docs/readme.md)
  - about the validation rules in AutoRest

  - [Client
  Runtimes](./docs/developer/architecture/Autorest-and-Clientruntimes.md) -
  information about the client runtimes required for using code generated by
  AutoRest

  <!-- - [Developer Guide](./docs/developer/guide/) - Notes on developing with
  AutoRest -->


  ### Supported Platforms


  While AutoRest itself runs on NodeJS, some generators use the .NET Core 2.0
  runtime, which is the most limiting factor.

  See

  # swagmock

  Mock data generator for swagger api


  *Note: Swagmock version `1.0.0` onwards requires `Node.js v6+` (`"engines":
  {"node": ">=6.x"}`). Please use `v0.0.x` (say `0.0.5`), if you want to run
  this module on any previous node.js versions.*


  ## Install


  ```

  npm install swagmock

  ```


  ## Usage


  ```javascript
      let Swagmock = require('swagmock');
      let Mockgen = Swagmock(api, options);
      // api Can be one of the following.
      // 1) A relative or absolute path to the Swagger api document.
      // 2) A swagger api Object.
      // 3) A promise (or a `thenable`) that resolves to the swagger api Object.
      // Set the `validated` : `true`  in `options`, if the api Object is already validated
      // and dereferenced ($ref are resolved ).
  ```


  Promise response:


  ```javascript
      let responseMock = Mockgen.responses({}); //returns a promise that resolves to response mock
      responseMock.then(mock => {
          //Use mock here
      }).catch(error => {
          Assert.ifError(error);
      });
  ```


  Callback style:


  ```javascript

      Mockgen.responses({ path: '/somepath'}, (error, mock) => {
          Assert.ifError(error);
          //Use mock here
      });
  ```


  Check the [API](README.md#api) for more details.


  ## Example


  Initialize the mock generator


  ```javascript
      const apiPath = 'http://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json';
      let Assert = require('assert');
      let Swagmock = require('swagmock');
      let Mockgen = Swagmock(apiPath);
  ```


  Response mock generation:


  ```javascript
      mockgen.responses({
          path: '/pet/findByStatus',
          operation: 'get',
          response: 200
      }).then(mock => {
          console.log(mock); // This would print:
          // {
          //     "responses": [{
          //         "id": 2530624032210944,
          //         "category": {
          //             "id": 8200505595527168,
          //             "name": "r($vA&"
          //         },
          //         "name": "doggie",
          //         "photoUrls": ["p0x1", "6O)3*kO"],
          //         "tags": [{
          //             "id": 4590764340281344,
          //             "name": "WCTA6f!"
          //         }, {
          //             "id": -4614156653166592,
          //             "name": "e"
          //         }],
          //         "status": "pending"
          //     }]
          // }
      }).catch(error => {
          Assert.ifError(error);
      });
  ```


  Parameters mock generation:


  ```javascript

      mockgen.parameters({
          path: '/pet/findByStatus',
          operation: 'get'
      }).then(mock => {
          console.log(mock);//This would print:
          // {
          //     "parameters": {
          //         "query": [{
          //             "name": "status",
          //             "value": [ 'available', 'pending' ],
          //             "separator": "multi"
          //         }]
          //     }
          // }
      }).catch(error => {
          Assert.ifError(error);
      })

  ```

  ## API


  `Swagmock(api, [options])`


  * `api` - (*Object*) or (*String*) or (*Promise*) - (required) - api can be
  one of the following.
      - A relative or absolute path to the Swagger api document.
      - A URL of the Swagger api document.
      - The swagger api Object
      - A promise (or a `thenable`) that resolves to the swagger api Object

  * `options` - (*Object*) - (optional) - Additional options to create the mock
  generator.
      - `validated` -  Set this property to `true` if the api is already validated against swagger schema and already dereferenced all the `$ref`. This is really useful to generate mocks for parsed api specs. Default value for this is `false` and the api will be validated using [swagger-parser validate](https://github.com/BigstickCarpet/swagger-parser/blob/master/docs/swagger-parser.md#validateapi-options-callback).

  ## responses


  `mockgen.responses(options, [callback])`


  This generates the mock response objects based on the `options`


  * `options` - (*Object*) - (required) - Options to control the mock
  generation.


  * `callback` -  (*Function*) - (optional) - `function (error, mock)`. If a
  callback is not provided a `Promise` will be returned.


  ### options


  * `path` - (*String*) - (optional) - The path for which the response mock need
  to be generated. For example `/pet/findByStatus`, `/pet` etc. If a `path` is
  not specified, mock response will be generated for all the paths defined by
  the swagger api.


  * `operation` - (*String*) - (optional) - The operation for which the response
  mock need to be generated. For example `get`, `post` etc. If `operation` is
  not specified, mock response will be generated for all the operations defined
  by the swagger api.


  * `response` - (*String*) - (optional) - The response for which the response
  mock need to be generated. For example `200`, `400`, `default` etc. If
  `response` is not specified, mock response will be generated for all the
  responses defined by the swagger api.


  * `useExamples` - (*Boolean*)- (optional) - Should the generated mock make use
  of example values defined in your swagger.json. Note: invalid example values
  will create invalid mockdata!


  ## parameters


  `mockgen.parameters(options, [callback])`


  This generates the mock parameters objects based on the `options`


  * `options` - (*Object*) - (required) - Options to control the mock
  generation.


  * `callback` -  (*Function*) - (optional) - `function (error, mock)`. If a
  callback is not provided a `Promise` will be returned.


  ### options


  * `path` - (*String*) - (optional) - The path for which the parameters mock
  need to be generated. For example `/pet/findByStatus`, `/pet` etc. If a `path`
  is not specified, mock parameters will be generated for all the paths defined
  by the swagger api.


  * `operation` - (*String*) - (optional) - The operation for which the
  parameters mock need to be generated. For example `get`, `post` etc. If
  `operation` is not specified, mock parameters will be generated for all the
  operations defined by the swagger api.



  ## requests


  `mockgen.requests(options, [callback])`


  This generates the mock request object based on the `options`. `requests` API
  resolves the `parameters` mock data to generate the `request` mock object
  useful for unit tests.


  * `options` - (*Object*) - (required) - Options to control the mock
  generation.


  * `callback` -  (*Function*) - (optional) - `function (error, mock)`. If a
  callback is not provided a `Promise` will be returned.


  ### options


  * `path` - (*String*) - (optional) - The path for which the parameters mock
  need to be generated. For example `/pet/findByStatus`, `/pet` etc. If a `path`
  is not specified, mock parameters will be generated for all the paths defined
  by the swagger api.


  * `operation` - (*String*) - (optional) - The operation for which the
  parameters mock need to be generated. For example `get`, `post` etc. If
  `operation` is not specified, mock parameters will be generated for all the
  operations defined by the swagger api.


  ### data


  `request` Object will have following possible properties `query`, `header`,
  `pathname`, `path`, `formData` or `body` based on the `parameters` defined for
  the path and operation.


  Mock request [Path templates](http://swagger.io/specification/#pathTemplating)
  are resolved using path parameters.


  ```javascript
      mockgen.requests({
          path: '/pet/findByStatus',
          operation: 'get'
      }, function (error, mock) {
          assert.ifError(error);

          console.log(mock);
          //This would print:
          // {
          //     "request": {
          //         "query": "status=available&status=pending"
          //     }
          // }
      });
  ```

  ======


  BlueOak Server is a NodeJS framework for building RESTful APIs.


  [![Build
  Status](https://travis-ci.org/BlueOakJS/blueoak-server.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/BlueOakJS/blueoak-server)

  [![npm
  version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/blueoak-server.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/blueoak-server)


  BlueOak Server is _swagger-matic_, that is, it maximizes the value of your
  Swagger API (now OpenAPI, but really this supports only V2) by using it to
  drive runtime behavior.  

  BlueOak Server loads your Swagger API, connects the paths it defines to your
  implementation code, exposes that API to the network, and validates that every
  request is well-formed per that API.


  Check out the documentation on our wiki:
  <https://github.com/BlueOakJS/blueoak-server/wiki>


  ### Overview


  BlueOak Server combines some of the best Node libraries into a single tool for
  building RESTful APIs.  It uses Express under the covers, but adds many
  additional features:


  - Swagger integration

  - Easy configuration

  - Clustering

  - Logging

  - Dependency injection


  Projects use the following directory structure.


  ```

  ├── [your_project_name]/

  │   ├── index.js <-- optional Main script

  │   ├── package.json

  |   ├── config/

  |   |     └── default.json

  │   ├── handlers/

  │   ├── services/

  │   ├── middleware/

  │   ├── swagger/

  ```


  #### Handlers

  [Handlers](https://github.com/BlueOakJS/blueoak-server/wiki/Handlers) contain
  Express route-handling functions.  They can either be directly wired to routes
  on the Express _app_, or defined using Swagger.


  To use the _app_ directly, simply create a js file in the handlers directory
  that exports an `init` function.

  The `init` function is called during server startup and injected with the the
  _app_ automatically.


  ```js

  exports.init = function(app) {
    app.get('/', function(req, res) {
      res.json({});
    });
  }


  ```


  #### Services

  [Services](https://github.com/BlueOakJS/blueoak-server/wiki/Services) do most
  of the heavy lifting.  Like handlers, services contain init functions that are
  called during server startup.  However, services can export other functions,
  and those functions can be invoked from handlers.


  Here's an example of a fizzbuzz service (services/fizzbuzz.js).  You'll notice
  it has an init method with two parameters, _logger_ and _callback_.  The
  _logger_ is a [built-in
  service](https://github.com/BlueOakJS/blueoak-server/wiki/Logging-Service) for
  logging.  The _callback_ is an optional parameter used for cases where
  services need to perform asynchronous operations during startup.  The service
  also exports a _getResult_ function.  Any service or handler with a dependency
  on _fizzbuzz_ can invoke `fizzbuzz.getResult`.


  ```js

  exports.init = function(logger, callback) {
    logger.info("Starting FizzBuzz service");
    callback();
  }


  exports.getResult = function(num) {
      if (num % 15 === 0) {
          return "FizzBuzz";
      } else if (num % 3 === 0) {
          return "Fizz";
      } else if (num % 5 === 0) {
          return "Buzz";
      } else {
          return num;
      }
  };
    
  ```


  We want to use that service from our handler, so we include `fizzbuzz` as a
  parameter of the `init` function.

  The server will ensure that the fizzbuzz service is initialized during server
  startup and passed to the handler.


  ```js

  exports.init = function(app, fizzbuzz) {

    app.get('/fizzbuzz/:num', function(req, res) {
      var num = req.params.num;
      res.json({
          result: fizzbuzz.getResult(num)
       });
    });
    
  }

  ```

  #### Third-party Services

  Services can be published as npm modules and pulled into projects through the
  `npm install` command.


  For example, the bos-couchdb service adds the ability to connect to a CouchDB
  database.

  It can be installed to a blueoak-server project using


  ```bash

  $ npm install bos-couchdb --save

  ```


  Once installed, it can be used in any service or handler through the
  dependency-injected `bosCouchdb` parameter.


  ```js

  exports.init = function(config, logger, bosCouchdb) {
    var myDb = bosCouchdb.get('mydb');
  }


  ```


  * [bos-couchdb](https://github.com/BlueOakJS/bos-couchdb) - service for
  connecting to CouchDB databases


  #### Config

  [Configuration](https://github.com/BlueOakJS/blueoak-server/wiki/Services#config)
  is stored in json files in the _config_ directory.  Values can be accessed
  through the `config` service in handers and services.  Configuration also
  supports layering on environment-specific config as well as encrypted values.


  ```js

  exports.init = function(config) {
    var myServiceConfig = config.get('myService');
  }

  ```


  #### Middleware

  [Middleware](https://github.com/BlueOakJS/blueoak-server/wiki/Middleware) are
  similar to services but used to wire up Express middleware.  The _express_
  section of the config determines which middleware is loaded and in which
  order.


  ```json

  {
    "express": {
      "middleware": ["csrf", "cors", "session", "body-parser"]
    }
  }

  ```


  #### Swagger (OpenAPI)


  [Swagger](https://github.com/BlueOakJS/blueoak-server/wiki/Handlers#swagger)
  files in the _swagger_ directory are read during server startup and
  automatically wired up to handlers. Swagger files can be in either json or
  yaml formats.


  We've really focused on making API development with Swagger and BlueOak Server
  to be excellent.


  At a high-level, BlueOak Server's Swagger support provides the following:

  * Automatic app routing from the API method to the function as defined in the
  Swagger

  * Request parameter validation, including the body model, based on your method
  definion

  * Reponse model validation based on your method definitions during development

  * JSON `$ref`s to external Swagger documents on the file system

  * Multiple top-level Swagger API definitions supporting delivery of multiple
  API base paths

  * Publishing of the fully compiled Swagger spec for input to by tools such as
  [`Swagger-UI`](http://swagger.io/swagger-ui/) and
  [`swagger-commander`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-commander)


  ### Installation


  ```bash

  $ npm install -g blueoak-server

  ```


  -or-


  ```bash

  $ npm install --save blueoak-server

  ```


  ### Usage


  If installed globally, run _blueoak-server_ from within your project's
  directory.

  e.g.:

  ```bash

  $ blueoak-server

  ```


  If installed at a package level, call _blueoak-server_ in the `npm start`
  script.

  e.g.:

  ```json
    "scripts": {
      "start": "blueoak-server"
    }
  ```


  Alternatively, it can be launched programmatically from your own js script.



  ```js

  var server = require('blueoak-server');


  server.init(function(err) {
      if (err) {
          console.warn(err);
      } else {
          console.log('started');
      }
  });

  ```


  The programmatic approach works well during development with tools like
  nodemon,

  which monitor for file changes and automatically restart the server.

  swagger-aggregator

  ==================


  Swagger-aggregator allow you to create a swagger REST API from several other
  swagger REST APIs.


  This can be really useful if you want to make an API Gateway accessing some of
  your internal APIs.

  You can also filter which path you want to deliver, and which properties of
  your definitions you don't want to show.


  Related Libraries

  -----------------

  You may find related libraries to this one:


  * https://github.com/Trax-air/swagger-tester: Auto-test your swagger API in
  your unit tests. All test calls are generated by your swagger file.

  * https://github.com/Trax-air/swagger-stub: A stub you can use in your
  client's unit tests. All the HTTP calls to your swagger API are mocked by
  default. You can also add your own mocked_calls in your test functions.

  * https://github.com/Trax-air/swagger-parser: A helper that parses swagger
  specs. You can access the HTTP actions / paths and some example data


  Example Usage

  -------------


  Here is an example of an aggregate configuration.


  .. code:: yaml

    args: pet_url

    info:
      version: "0.1"
      title: "API Gateway"

    basePath: /v2

    apis:
        pet: http://pet_url/v2

    exclude_paths:
      - DELETE /pets/{petId}

    exclude_fields:
      petPet:
        - id

  This is not the most useful aggregation, as it only aggregate one API.

  The first part, `args`, define that the first parameter we will send to the
  aggregate will be pet_url. Then pet_url will be replaced by the given value
  everywhere in the config.

  The two next part, `info` and `basePath`, are the same as the ones you can
  find in every swagger API.

  `apis`, define the different APIs you want to aggregate. A name is associated
  with it URL.

  Then `exclude_paths` allow you to not deliver some path. In this case we don't
  want the user to delete a pet.


  Finally, `exclude_fields` define the attributes of the definitions we do not
  want to show.

  The value of the keys is the name of the API followed by the name of the
  definition. The value of each key will be a list of all properties to exclude.


  Then use this command to generate the aggregated swagger file:


  .. code:: python

    from traxit_aggregator import SwaggerAggregator

    SwaggerAggregator('config.yaml', 'pet.com')

  Flask-swagger provides a method (swagger) that inspects the Flask app for
  endpoints that contain YAML docstrings with Swagger 2.0
  [Operation](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#operation-object)
  objects.

  ```

  Flask-swagger supports docstrings in methods of MethodView classes (à la
  [Flask-RESTful](https://github.com/flask-restful/flask-restful)) and regular
  Flask view functions.


  Following YAML conventions, flask-swagger searches for `---`, everything
  preceding is provided as `summary` (first line) and `description` (following
  lines) for the endpoint while everything after is parsed as a swagger
  [Operation](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#operation-object)
  object.


  In order to support inline definition of [Schema
  ](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#schemaObject)
  objects in
  [Parameter](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#parameterObject) 
  and
  [Response](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#responsesObject)
  objects, flask-swagger veers a little off from the standard. We require an
  `id` field for the inline Schema which is then used to correctly place the
  [Schema](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#schemaObject)
  object in the
  [Definitions](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#definitionsObject)
  object.



  [Schema
  ](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#schemaObject)
  objects can be defined in a definitions section within the docstrings (see
  group object above) or within responses or parameters (see user object above).
  We also support schema objects nested within the properties of other [Schema
  ](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#schemaObject)
  objects. An example is shown above with the address property of User.


  If you don't like to put YAML on docstrings you can put the same content in an
  external file.


  #### file.yml

  ```yaml

  Create a new user

  ---

  tags:
    - users
  definitions:
    - schema:
        id: Group
        properties:
          name:
           type: string
           description: the group's name
  parameters:
    - in: body
      name: body
      schema:
        id: User
        required:
          - email
          - name
        properties:
          email:
            type: string
            description: email for user
          name:
            type: string
            description: name for user
          address:
            description: address for user
            schema:
              id: Address
              properties:
                street:
                  type: string
                state:
                  type: string
                country:
                  type: string
                postalcode:
                  type: string
          groups:
            type: array
            description: list of groups
            items:
              $ref: "#/definitions/Group"
  responses:
    201:
      description: User created
  ```


  and point to it in your docstring.


  ```python

  class UserAPI(MethodView):

      def post(self):
          """
          Create a new user

          blah blah

          swagger_from_file: path/to/file.yml

          blah blah
          """
          return {}
  ```


  Note that you can replace `swagger_from_file` by another keyword. Supply your
  chosen keyword as an argument to swagger. 



  To expose your Swagger specification to the world you provide a Flask route
  that does something along these lines


  ```python

  from flask import Flask, jsonify

  from flask_swagger import swagger


  app = Flask(__name__)


  @app.route("/spec")

  def spec():
      return jsonify(swagger(app))
  ```


  Note that the Swagger specification returned by `swagger(app)` is as minimal
  as it can be. It's your job to override and add to the specification as you
  see fit.


  ```python

  @app.route("/spec")

  def spec():
      swag = swagger(app)
      swag['info']['version'] = "1.0"
      swag['info']['title'] = "My API"
      return jsonify(swag)
  ```



  [Swagger-UI](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui)


  Swagger-UI is the reason we embarked on this mission to begin with,
  flask-swagger does not however include Swagger-UI. Simply follow the awesome
  documentation over at https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui and point your
  [swaggerUi.url](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui#swaggerui) to your
  new flask-swagger endpoint and enjoy.


  ## flaskswagger Command

  This package now comes with a very simple command line interface:
  flaskswagger. This command can be used to build and update swagger specs for
  your flask apps from the command line or at build time.


  ```shell

  flaskswagger -h

  ```


  ```

  usage: flaskswagger [-h] [--template TEMPLATE] [--out-dir OUT_DIR]
                      [--definitions DEFINITIONS] [--host HOST]
                      [--base-path BASE_PATH] [--version VERSION]
                      app

  positional arguments:
    app                   the flask app to swaggerify

  optional arguments:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    --template TEMPLATE   template spec to start with, before any other options
                          or processing
    --out-dir OUT_DIR     the directory to output to
    --definitions DEFINITIONS
                          json definitions file
    --host HOST
    --base-path BASE_PATH
    --version VERSION     Specify a spec version

  ```


  For example, this can be used to build a swagger spec which can be served from
  your static directory. In the example below, we use the manually created
  swagger.json.manual as a template, and output to the `static/` directory.


  ```shell

  flaskswagger server:app --template static/swagger.json.manual --out-dir
  static/

  ```

  Also, you can ask flaskswagger to add host and basePath to your swagger
  spec:  


  ```shell

  flaskswagger server:app --host localhost:5000 --base-path /v1

  ```

  ## Installation


  Swagger Tools is available for both Node.js and the browser.  Installation
  instructions for each environment are below.


  ### Browser


  Installation for browser applications can be done via [Bower][bower] or by
  downloading a standalone binary.


  #### Using Bower


  ```

  bower install swagger-tools --save

  ```


  #### Standalone Binaries


  The standalone binaries come in two flavors:


  *
  [swagger-tools-standalone.js](https://raw.github.com/apigee-127/swagger-tools/master/browser/swagger-tools-standalone.js):
  _2,280kb_, full source _(including all dependencies)_ and source maps

  *
  [swagger-tools-standalone-min.js](https://raw.github.com/apigee-127/swagger-tools/master/browser/swagger-tools-standalone-min.js):
  _316kb_, minified, compressed

  and no sourcemap


  ### Node.js


  Installation for Node.js applications can be done via [NPM][npm].


  ```

  npm install swagger-tools --save

  ```


  If you want to use the `swagger-tools` executable for validating Swagger
  documents, you can install swagger-tools

  globally using the following:


  ```

  npm install -g swagger-tools

  ```


  ## Documentation


  swagger-tools is heavily documented so head on over to the project 
  [documentation][documentation] or jump straight to

  the [Quick Start][quick-start].


  ## Contributing


  This project uses [Gulp][gulp] for building so `npm install -g gulp` once you
  clone this project.  Running `gulp` in the

  project root will lint check the source code and run the unit tests.

  # SBT Swagger Code Generator


  ## Overview


  Like the official
  [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) this project
  aims to generate Scala source code from [Swagger 2.0
  Specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md)
  compliant API descriptions.

  Moreover, you can do it directly within an `sbt` project.


  ## Compatibility


  This code generator is designed specifically for Swagger Spec Version 2.0.
  Moreover, it relies on [Play! Framework](http://www.playframework.com/) 2.7
  for Json marshalling/unmarshalling, server- and client-side code.


  ## Install


  Current release is
  [`0.0.12`](https://github.com/unicredit/sbt-swagger-codegen/tree/0.0.12)


  If you want to try the latest version on `master`, first clone this project
  and `publishLocal` it.


  Enable it inside your `project\plugins.sbt` like this:


  `addSbtPlugin("eu.unicredit" % "sbt-swagger-codegen" % "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT")`


  Enable it in your `build.sbt` like this:


  `enablePlugins(SwaggerCodegenPlugin)`


  ## Quick start


  For a *super fast* hands-on tutorial refer to the related examples and check
  out
  [sbt-swagger-codegen-examples](https://github.com/unicredit/sbt-swagger-codegen-examples).


  ## How it works


  By default, the plugin will assume that you have put your `yaml` Swagger
  specification files under `src/main/swagger`.


  If so, then you can just run `swaggerModelCodeGen` task and it will generate
  your *models* as case classes and [Play Framework](www.playframework.com)
  [Formats](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.5.x/ScalaJsonCombinators#Format)
  for them (for json serialization).


  ## Tasks


  All available tasks from the plugin


  - `swaggerModelCodeGen`  -> generated code for model classes

  - `swaggerServerCodeGen` -> generates Play Framework code

  - `swaggerClientCodeGen` -> generates client code using `play-ws`

  - `swaggerClean` -> cleans up already generated code


  The `swaggerModelCodeGen`, `swaggerServerCodeGen` and `swaggerClientCodeGen`
  will run automatically when the swagger sources change.


  ## Keys (and defaults)


  These keys influence properties of the generated code itself:


  - `swaggerSourcesDir` -> "/src/main/swagger" (path where to search for swagger
  files)

  - `swaggerCodeGenPackage` -> "swagger.codegen" (package name of the generated
  sources)

  - `swaggerModelFileSplitting` -> "oneFilePerSource" (in model generation how
  to group classes in '.scala' files available options are "oneFilePerSource"
  "oneFilePerModel")

  - `swaggerCodeProvidedPackage` -> "com.yourcompany" (where you will provide
  business logic server method implementation)


  These keys determine where generated files will be put:


  - `swaggerModelCodeTargetDir` ->
  "target/scala-2.1x/src_managed/src/main/swagger/model" (path where to put
  generated model files)

  - `swaggerClientCodeTargetDir` ->
  "target/scala-2.1x/src_managed/src/main/swagger/client" (path where to put
  generated client code files)

  - `swaggerServerCodeTargetDir` ->
  "target/scala-2.1x/src_managed/src/main/swagger/server" (path where to put
  generated server code files)


  These keys can be used to determine what kind of code should be generated:


  - `swaggerGenerateModel` -> true (to be disabled if you do not want model
  classes to be generated automatically when swagger source code changes)

  - `swaggerGenerateJsonRW` -> true (if you want to generate json Format for
  your model case classes)

  - `swaggerGenerateClient` -> false (enable this if you want client code to ge
  generated automatically when swagger source code changes)

  - `swaggerGenerateServer` -> false (enable this if you want client code to ge
  generated automatically when swagger source code changes)


  Moreover, you can extend this plugin by providing alternative implementations
  of the generators via:


  - `swaggerModelCodeGenClass` -> new
  eu.unicredit.swagger.generators.DefaultModelGenerator() (the class used to
  generate the model classes)

  - `swaggerJsonCodeGenClass` -> new
  eu.unicredit.swagger.generators.DefaultJsonGenerator() (the class used to
  generate the json marshaller/unmarshaller)

  - `swaggerServerCodeGenClass` -> new
  eu.unicredit.swagger.generators.DefaultServerGenerator() (the class used to
  generate the Server classes)

  - `swaggerClientCodeGenClass` -> new
  eu.unicredit.swagger.generators.DefaultClientGenerator() (the class used to
  generate the client classes)


  ## Dependencies


  - scala version 2.12.X

  - [play-ws-standalone-json
  1.1.3](http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.typesafe.play/play-ws-standalone-json)

  - [play-ahc-ws-standalone
  1.1.3](http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.typesafe.play/play-ahc-ws-standalone)
  (only if you use client)


  ### Limitations


  At the moment the project is developed to fulfill some internal projects
  needs, so do not expect it to cover all the corner cases of the Swagger Spec
  (i.e. some primitive types in body req or resp).


  ## The road ahead


  We are actively working with and on this project, trying to overcome any
  arising limitations and support all Swagger-spec properties we need.

  PRs are really welcome and please open an Issue if you find that something is
  not working.

  swagger-stub

  ==============


  Swagger-stub create automatically a stub of your swagger REST API. This stub
  can be used anywhere you want like in a pytest fixture for your unit test.


  In addition of mocking your API, you can mock some call, and check every call
  that have been made to the API.

  specs into one. Useful for your API gateways!

  * https://github.com/Trax-air/swagger-parser: A helper that parses swagger

  Example Usage

  -------------


  .. code:: python

    import pytest
    import requests

    from swagger_stub import swagger_stub

    # This is the fixture of your stub
    # You only need to specify the path of the swagger file and the address
    # where you want to bind your stub.
    @pytest.fixture
    def test_stub():
        return swagger_stub([('swagger.yaml', 'http://foo.com')]).next()

    # Then you can use this fixture anywhere you want like your API is really running.
    def test_swagger_stub(test_stub):
        # Get a definition example
        test_stub.definitions['Foo']

        # Check a simple call
        response = requests.get('http://foo.com/v1/bar/')
        assert response.status_code == 200
        assert response.json() == {
          'foo': 'bar'
        }

        # Check that an invalid body cause an error
        response = requests.post('http://foo.com/v1/bar/', data='invalid data')
        assert response.status_code == 400

        # Mock a call
        test_stub.add_mock_call('get', '/test', {'mock': 'call'})
        response = requests.get('http://foo.com/v1/test')
        assert response.json() == {'mock': 'call'}

        # Set some side_effect like in the mock library
        test_stub.add_mock_side_effect('get', '/iter', [{'test': '1'}, {'test': '2'}, {'test': '3'}])
        response = requests.get('http://foo.com/v1/iter')
        assert response.json() == {'test': '1'}
        response = requests.get('http://foo.com/v1/iter')
        assert response.json() == {'test': '2'}
        response = requests.get('http://foo.com/v1/iter')
        assert response.json() == {'test': '3'}

        # This side effect will raise a custom error
        test_stub.add_mock_side_effect('get', '/error', Exception)

        with pytest.raises(Exception):
            response = requests.get('http://foo.com/v1/error')

  _"The confident hippie"_


  [![js-standard-style](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](http://standardjs.com/)

  [![Build
  Status](https://travis-ci.org/CacheControl/hippie-swagger.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/CacheControl/hippie-swagger)

  [![npm
  version](https://badge.fury.io/js/hippie-swagger.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/hippie-swagger)


  ## Synopsis


  ```hippie-swagger``` is a tool for testing RESTful APIs.  In addition to
  validating api behavior, it will fail tests when swagger documentation is
  missing or inaccurate.


  As the test suite runs, any request or response details *not* matching the
  swagger file will throw an appropriate exception, failing the spec.  This
  ensures the swagger definition accurately describes application behavior,
  keeping documentation in sync with reality.


  ```hippie-swagger``` uses [hippie](https://github.com/vesln/hippie) under the
  hood, an excellent API testing tool.


  ## Features


  * All [hippie](https://github.com/vesln/hippie) features included

  * All aspects of swagger file validated; parameters, request/response body,
  paths, etc.

  * Checks for extra parameters, paths, headers, etc not mentioned in the
  swagger file

  * Ensures swagger file accurately describes API behavior

  * Accurate, human readable assertion messages


  ## Installation


  ```

  npm install hippie-swagger --save-dev

  ```


  ## Basic Usage


  ```js

  var hippie = require('hippie-swagger'),
      swagger = require('./my-dereferenced-swagger-file'); // see example for how to dereference swagger

  hippie(app, swagger)

  .get('/users/{username}')

  .pathParams({
    username: 'cachecontrol'
  })

  .expectStatus(200)

  .expectValue('user.first', 'John')

  .expectHeader('cache-control', 'no-cache')

  .end(function(err, res, body) {
    if (err) throw err;
  });

  ```


  ## Usage

  * See [hippie](https://github.com/vesln/hippie) documentation for a
  description of the base api

  * When specifying a url(.get, .post, .patch, .url, etc), use the [swagger
  path](http://swagger.io/specification/#pathsObject)

  * Provide any path variables using [pathParams](#pathparams)


  These aside, use hippie as you normally would; see the
  [example](example/index.js).


  ## Methods


  ### #constructor (Object app, Object swagger, Object [options])


  Test an HTTP app (like express) directly


  ```js

  hippie(app, swagger, options)

  .get('/projects')

  .end(fn);

  ```


  ### #constructor (Object swagger, Object [options])


  Test a remote HTTP app using a fully qualified url


  ```js

  hippie(swagger, options)

  .get('http://localhost:3000/projects')

  .end(fn);

  ```


  ### #pathParams(Object hash)


  Replaces variables contained in the swagger path.


  ```js

  hippie(app, swagger)

  .get('/projects/{projectId}/tasks/{taskId}')

  .pathParams({
    projectId: 123,
    taskId: 99
  })

  .end(fn);

  ```


  ## Options


  To customize behavior, an ```options``` hash may be passed to the
  constructor.  Typically, ```options``` only need to be specified in situations
  where the test covers responses to improper requests (e.g. validating the
  application returns a 422 when a required parameter is not provided).


  ```js

  var options = {
    validateResponseSchema: true,
    validateParameterSchema: true,
    errorOnExtraParameters: true,
    errorOnExtraHeaderParameters: false
  };

  hippie(app, swagger, options)

  ```


  ```validateResponseSchema``` - Validate the server's response against the
  swagger json-schema definition (default: ```true```)


  ```validateParameterSchema``` - Validate the request parameters against the
  swagger json-schema definition (default: ```true```)


  ```validateRequiredParameters``` - Validate that required parameters were
  provided  (default: ```true```)


  ```errorOnExtraParameters``` - Throw an error if a parameter is missing from
  the swagger file  (default: ```true```)


  ```errorOnExtraHeaderParameters``` - Throw an error if a request header is
  missing from the swagger file.  By default this is turned off, because it
  results in every request needing to specify the "Content-Type" and "Accept"
  headers, which quickly becomes verbose. (default: ```false```)



  ## Example

  See the [example](example/index.js) folder


  ## Validations


  When hippie-swagger detects it is interacting with the app in ways not
  specified in the swagger file, it will throw an error and fail the test.  The
  idea is to use hippie's core features to write API tests as per usual, and
  hippie-swagger will only interject if the swagger contract is violated.


  Below are list of some of the validations that hippie-swagger checks for:


  ### Paths

  ```js

  hippie(app, swagger)

  .get('/pathNotMentionedInSwagger')

  .end(fn);

  // path does not exist in swagger file; throws:

  //    Swagger spec does not define path: pathNotMentionedInSwagger

  ```


  ### Parameter format

  ```js

  hippie(app, swagger)

  .get('/users/{userId}')

  .pathParams({
    userId: 'string-value',
  })

  .end(fn);

  // userId provided as a string, but swagger specifies it as an integer;
  throws:

  //    Invalid format for parameter {userId}

  ```


  ### Required Parameters

  ```js

  hippie(app, swagger)

  .get('/users/{username}')

  .end(fn);

  // "username" is marked 'required' in swagger file; throws:

  //    Missing required parameter in path: username

  ```


  ### Extraneous Parameters

  ```js

  hippie(app, swagger)

  .get('/users')

  .qs({ page: 2, limit: 30 })

  .end(fn);

  // "page" missing from swagger file; throws:

  //    Error: query parameter not mentioned in swagger spec: "page", available
  params: limit

  ```


  ### Response format

  ```js

  hippie(app, swagger)

  .get('/users')

  .end(fn);

  // body failed to validate against swagger file's "response" schema; throws:

  //    Response from /users failed validation: [failure description]

  ```


  ### Method validation

  ```js

  hippie(app, swagger)

  .post('/users')

  .end(fn);

  // "post" method not mentioned in swagger file; throws:

  //    Swagger spec does not define method: "post" in path /users

  ```


  ### Post body format

  ```js

  hippie(app, swagger)

  .post('/users')

  .send({"bogus":"post-body"})

  .end(fn);


  // post body fails to validate against swagger file's "body" parameter;
  throws:

  //    Invalid format for parameter {body}, received: {"bogus":"post-body"}

  ```


  ### Form Url-Encoded Parameters

  ```js

  hippie(app, swagger)

  .form()

  .post('/users')

  .send({})

  .end(fn);


  // "username" is {required: true, in: formData} in swagger; throws:

  //    Missing required parameter in formData: username

  ```


  ### Multipart Forms

  ```js

  hippie(app, swagger)

  .header('Content-Type','multipart/form-data')

  .send()

  .post('/users/upload')

  .end(fn);


  // "fileUpload" is {required: true, in: formData, type: file} in swagger;
  throws:

  //    Missing required parameter in formData: fileUpload

  ```


  ## Troubleshooting


  The most common mistake is forgetting to dereference the swagger file:


  ```js

  "'Error: cant resolve reference ...'

  ```


  Dereferencing can be accomplished using
  [swagger-parser](https://github.com/BigstickCarpet/swagger-parser/blob/master/docs/swagger-parser.md#dereferenceapi-options-callback). 
  The [example](example/index.js) gives a demonstration.

  green tests, run a rake task to auto-generate corresponding Swagger files and
  expose them as YAML or JSON endpoints. Rswag also provides an embedded version
  of the awesome [swagger-ui](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui) that's
  powered by the exposed file. This toolchain makes it seamless to go from
  integration specs, which youre probably doing in some form already, to living
  documentation for your API consumers.


  Api Rswag creates [Swagger](http://swagger.io) tooling for Rails API's.
  Generate beautiful API documentation, including a UI to explore and test
  operations, directly from your rspec integration tests.



  And that's not all ...


  Once you have an API that can describe itself in Swagger, you've opened the
  treasure chest of Swagger-based tools including a client generator that can be
  targeted to a wide range of popular platforms. See
  [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) for more
  details.

  ## Getting Started ##


  1. Add this line to your applications _Gemfile_:

      ```ruby
      gem 'rswag'
      ```

      or if you like to avoid loading rspec in other bundler groups load the rswag-specs component separately.
      Note: Adding it to the :development group is not strictly necessary, but without it, generators and rake tasks must be preceded by RAILS_ENV=test.

      ```ruby
      # Gemfile
      gem 'rswag-api'
      gem 'rswag-ui'

      group :development, :test do
        gem 'rspec-rails'
        gem 'rswag-specs'
      end
      ```

  2. Run the install generator

      ```ruby
      rails g rswag:install
      ```

      Or run the install generators for each package separately if you installed Rswag as separate gems, as indicated above:

      ```ruby
      rails g rswag:api:install
      rails g rswag:ui:install
      RAILS_ENV=test rails g rswag:specs:install
      ```

  3. Create an integration spec to describe and test your API.

  There is also a generator which can help get you started `rails generate
  rspec:swagger API::MyController`

      ```ruby
      # spec/integration/blogs_spec.rb
      require 'swagger_helper'

      describe 'Blogs API' do

        path '/blogs' do

          post 'Creates a blog' do
            tags 'Blogs'
            consumes 'application/json'
            parameter name: :blog, in: :body, schema: {
              type: :object,
              properties: {
                title: { type: :string },
                content: { type: :string }
              },
              required: [ 'title', 'content' ]
            }

            response '201', 'blog created' do
              let(:blog) { { title: 'foo', content: 'bar' } }
              run_test!
            end

            response '422', 'invalid request' do
              let(:blog) { { title: 'foo' } }
              run_test!
            end
          end
        end

        path '/blogs/{id}' do

          get 'Retrieves a blog' do
            tags 'Blogs'
            produces 'application/json', 'application/xml'
            parameter name: :id, in: :path, type: :string

            response '200', 'blog found' do
              schema type: :object,
                properties: {
                  id: { type: :integer },
                  title: { type: :string },
                  content: { type: :string }
                },
                required: [ 'id', 'title', 'content' ]

              let(:id) { Blog.create(title: 'foo', content: 'bar').id }
              run_test!
            end

            response '404', 'blog not found' do
              let(:id) { 'invalid' }
              run_test!
            end

            response '406', 'unsupported accept header' do
              let(:'Accept') { 'application/foo' }
              run_test!
            end
          end
        end
      end
      ```


  4. Generate the Swagger JSON file(s)

      ```ruby
      rake rswag:specs:swaggerize
      ```

      This common command is also aliased as `rake rswag`.

      Or if you installed your gems separately:
      ```
      RAILS_ENV=test rails rswag
      ```

  5. Spin up your app and check out the awesome, auto-generated docs at
  _/api-docs_!


  ## The rspec DSL ##


  ### Paths, Operations and Responses ###


  If you've used [Swagger](http://swagger.io/specification) before, then the
  syntax should be very familiar. To describe your API operations, start by
  specifying a path and then list the supported operations (i.e. HTTP verbs) for
  that path. Path parameters must be surrounded by curly braces ({}). Within an
  operation block (see "post" or "get" in the example above), most of the fields
  supported by the [Swagger "Operation"
  object](http://swagger.io/specification/#operationObject) are available as
  methods on the example group. To list (and test) the various responses for an
  operation, create one or more response blocks. Again, you can reference the
  [Swagger "Response" object](http://swagger.io/specification/#responseObject)
  for available fields.


  Take special note of the __run_test!__ method that's called within each
  response block. This tells rswag to create and execute a corresponding
  example. It builds and submits a request based on parameter descriptions and
  corresponding values that have been provided using the rspec "let" syntax. For
  example, the "post" description in the example above specifies a "body"
  parameter called "blog". It also lists 2 different responses. For the success
  case (i.e. the 201 response), notice how "let" is used to set the blog
  parameter to a value that matches the provided schema. For the failure case
  (i.e. the 422 response), notice how it's set to a value that does not match
  the provided schema. When the test is executed, rswag also validates the
  actual response code and, where applicable, the response body against the
  provided [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/documentation.html).


  If you want to do additional validation on the response, pass a block to the
  __run_test!__ method:


  ```ruby

  response '201', 'blog created' do
    run_test! do |response|
      data = JSON.parse(response.body)
      expect(data['title']).to eq('foo')
    end
  end

  ```


  If you'd like your specs to be a little more explicit about what's going on
  here, you can replace the call to __run_test!__ with equivalent "before" and
  "it" blocks:


  ```ruby

  response '201', 'blog created' do
    let(:blog) { { title: 'foo', content: 'bar' } }

    before do |example|
      submit_request(example.metadata)
    end

    it 'returns a valid 201 response' do |example|
      assert_response_matches_metadata(example.metadata)
    end
  end

  ```


  ### Null Values ###


  This library is currently using JSON::Draft4 for validation of response
  models. Nullable properties can be supported with the non-standard property
  'x-nullable' to a definition to allow null/nil values to pass. Or you can add
  the new standard ```nullable``` property to a definition.

  ```ruby

  describe 'Blogs API' do
    path '/blogs' do
      post 'Creates a blog' do
        ...

        response '200', 'blog found' do
          schema type: :object,
            properties: {
              id: { type: :integer },
              title: { type: :string, nullable: true }, # preferred syntax
              content: { type: :string, 'x-nullable': true } # legacy syntax, but still works
            }
          ....
        end
      end
    end
  end

  ```


  ### Support for oneOf, anyOf or AllOf schemas ###


  Open API 3.0 now supports more flexible schema validation with the
  ```oneOf```, ```anyOf``` and ```allOf``` directives. rswag will handle these
  definitions and validate them properly.



  Notice the ```schema``` inside the ```response``` section. Placing a
  ```schema``` method inside the response will validate (and fail the tests)

  if during the integration test run the endpoint response does not match the
  response schema. This test validation can handle anyOf and allOf as well. See
  below:


  ```ruby

    path '/blogs/flexible' do
      post 'Creates a blog flexible body' do
        tags 'Blogs'
        description 'Creates a flexible blog from provided data'
        operationId 'createFlexibleBlog'
        consumes 'application/json'
        produces 'application/json'

        parameter name: :blog, in: :body, schema: {
            oneOf: [
              { '$ref' => '#/components/schemas/blog' },
              { '$ref' => '#/components/schemas/flexible_blog' }
            ]
          }

        response '201', 'flexible blog created' do
          schema oneOf: [{ '$ref' => '#/components/schemas/blog' }, { '$ref' => '#/components/schemas/flexible_blog' }]
          run_test!
        end
      end
    end

  ```

  This automatic schema validation is a powerful feature of rswag.


  ### Global Metadata ###


  In addition to paths, operations and responses, Swagger also supports global
  API metadata. When you install rswag, a file called _swagger_helper.rb_ is
  added to your spec folder. This is where you define one or more Swagger
  documents and provide global metadata. Again, the format is based on Swagger
  so most of the global fields supported by the top level ["Swagger"
  object](http://swagger.io/specification/#swaggerObject) can be provided with
  each document definition. As an example, you could define a Swagger document
  for each version of your API and in each case specify a title, version string.
  In Open API 3.0 the pathing and server definitions have changed a bit [Swagger
  host/basePath](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/api-host-and-base-path/):


  ```ruby

  # spec/swagger_helper.rb

  RSpec.configure do |config|
    config.swagger_root = Rails.root.to_s + '/swagger'

    config.swagger_docs = {
      'v1/swagger.json' => {
        openapi: '3.0.1',
        info: {
          title: 'API V1',
          version: 'v1',
          description: 'This is the first version of my API'
        },
        servers: [
          {
            url: 'https://{defaultHost}',
            variables: {
              defaultHost: {
                  default: 'www.example.com'
              }
            }
          }
        ]
      },

      'v2/swagger.yaml' => {
        openapi: '3.0.1',
        info: {
          title: 'API V2',
          version: 'v2',
          description: 'This is the second version of my API'
        },
        servers: [
          {
            url: 'https://{defaultHost}',
            variables: {
              defaultHost: {
                  default: 'www.example.com'
              }
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  end

  ```


  #### Supporting multiple versions of API ####

  By default, the paths, operations and responses defined in your spec files
  will be associated with the first Swagger document in _swagger_helper.rb_. If
  your API has multiple versions, you should be using separate documents to
  describe each of them. In order to assign a file with a given version of API,
  you'll need to add the ```swagger_doc``` tag to each spec specifying its
  target document name:


  ```ruby

  # spec/integration/v2/blogs_spec.rb

  describe 'Blogs API', swagger_doc: 'v2/swagger.yaml' do

    path '/blogs' do
    ...

    path '/blogs/{id}' do
    ...
  end

  ```


  #### Formatting the description literals: ####

  Swagger supports the Markdown syntax to format strings. This can be especially
  handy if you were to provide a long description of a given API version or
  endpoint. Use [this
  guide](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for
  reference.


  __NOTE:__ There is one difference between the official Markdown syntax and
  Swagger interpretation, namely tables. To create a table like this:


  | Column1 | Collumn2 |

  | ------- | -------- |

  | cell1   | cell2    |


  you should use the folowing syntax, making sure there are no whitespaces at
  the start of any of the lines:


  ```

  &#13;

  | Column1 | Collumn2 |&#13;

  | ------- | -------- |&#13;

  | cell1   | cell2    |&#13;

  &#13;

  ```


  ### Specifying/Testing API Security ###


  Swagger allows for the specification of different security schemes and their
  applicability to operations in an API. 

  To leverage this in rswag, you define the schemes globally in
  _swagger_helper.rb_ and then use the "security" attribute at the operation
  level to specify which schemes, if any, are applicable to that operation. 

  Swagger supports :basic, :bearer, :apiKey and :oauth2 and :openIdConnect
  scheme types. See [the
  spec](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/) for more info, as
  this underwent major changes between Swagger 2.0 and Open API 3.0


  ```ruby

  # spec/swagger_helper.rb

  RSpec.configure do |config|
    config.swagger_root = Rails.root.to_s + '/swagger'

    config.swagger_docs = {
      'v1/swagger.json' => {
        ...  # note the new Open API 3.0 compliant security structure here, under "components"
        components: {
          securitySchemes: {
            basic_auth: {
              type: :http,
              scheme: :basic
            },
            api_key: {
              type: :apiKey,
              name: 'api_key',
              in: :query
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  end


  # spec/integration/blogs_spec.rb

  describe 'Blogs API' do

    path '/blogs' do

      post 'Creates a blog' do
        tags 'Blogs'
        security [ basic_auth: [] ]
        ...

        response '201', 'blog created' do
          let(:Authorization) { "Basic #{::Base64.strict_encode64('jsmith:jspass')}" }
          run_test!
        end

        response '401', 'authentication failed' do
          let(:Authorization) { "Basic #{::Base64.strict_encode64('bogus:bogus')}" }
          run_test!
        end
      end
    end
  end


  # example of documenting an endpoint that handles basic auth and api key based
  security

  describe 'Auth examples API' do 
    path '/auth-tests/basic-and-api-key' do
      post 'Authenticates with basic auth and api key' do
        tags 'Auth Tests'
        operationId 'testBasicAndApiKey'
        security [{ basic_auth: [], api_key: [] }]

        response '204', 'Valid credentials' do
          let(:Authorization) { "Basic #{::Base64.strict_encode64('jsmith:jspass')}" }
          let(:api_key) { 'foobar' }
          run_test!
        end

        response '401', 'Invalid credentials' do
          let(:Authorization) { "Basic #{::Base64.strict_encode64('jsmith:jspass')}" }
          let(:api_key) { 'barfoo' }
          run_test!
        end
      end
    end
  end
   

  ```


  __NOTE:__ Depending on the scheme types, you'll be required to assign a
  corresponding parameter value with each example. 

  For example, :basic auth is required above and so the :Authorization (header)
  parameter must be set accordingly


  ## Configuration & Customization ##


  The steps described above will get you up and running with minimal setup.
  However, rswag offers a lot of flexibility to customize as you see fit. Before
  exploring the various options, you'll need to be aware of it's different
  components. The following table lists each of them and the files that get
  added/updated as part of a standard install.


  |Gem|Description|Added/Updated|

  |---------|-----------|-------------|

  |__rswag-specs__|Swagger-based DSL for rspec & accompanying rake task for
  generating Swagger files|_spec/swagger_helper.rb_|

  |__rswag-api__  |Rails Engine that exposes your Swagger files as JSON
  endpoints|_config/initializers/rswag_api.rb, config/routes.rb_|

  |__rswag-ui__   |Rails Engine that includes
  [swagger-ui](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui) and powers it from
  your Swagger endpoints|_config/initializers/rswag-ui.rb, config/routes.rb_|


  ### Output Location for Generated Swagger Files ###


  You can adjust this in the _swagger_helper.rb_ that's installed with
  __rswag-specs__:


  ```ruby

  # spec/swagger_helper.rb

  RSpec.configure do |config|
    config.swagger_root = Rails.root.to_s + '/your-custom-folder-name'
    ...
  end

  ```


  __NOTE__: If you do change this, you'll also need to update the rswag_api.rb
  initializer (assuming you're using rswag-api). More on this later.


  ### Input Location for Rspec Tests ###


  By default, rswag will search for integration tests in _spec/requests_,
  _spec/api_ and _spec/integration_. If you want to use tests from other
  locations, provide the PATTERN argument to rake:


  ```ruby

  # search for tests in spec/swagger

  rake rswag:specs:swaggerize PATTERN="spec/swagger/**/*_spec.rb"

  ```


  ### Referenced Parameters and Schema Definitions ###


  Swagger allows you to describe JSON structures inline with your operation
  descriptions OR as referenced globals. 

  For example, you might have a standard response structure for all failed
  operations.

  Again, this is a structure that changed since swagger 2.0. Notice the new
  "schemas" section for these. 

  Rather than repeating the schema in every operation spec, you can define it
  globally and provide a reference to it in each spec:


  ```ruby

  # spec/swagger_helper.rb

  config.swagger_docs = {
    'v1/swagger.json' => {
      openapi: '3.0.0',
      info: {
        title: 'API V1'
      },
      components: {
        schemas: {
          errors_object: {
            type: 'object',
            properties: {
              errors: { '$ref' => '#/components/schemas/errors_map' }
            }
          },
          errors_map: {
            type: 'object',
            additionalProperties: {
              type: 'array',
              items: { type: 'string' }
            }
          },
          blog: {
            type: 'object',
            properties: {
              id: { type: 'integer' },
              title: { type: 'string' },
              content: { type: 'string', nullable: true },
              thumbnail: { type: 'string', nullable: true }
            },
            required: %w[id title]
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }


  # spec/integration/blogs_spec.rb

  describe 'Blogs API' do

    path '/blogs' do

      post 'Creates a blog' do

        response 422, 'invalid request' do
          schema '$ref' => '#/components/schemas/errors_object'
    ...
  end


  # spec/integration/comments_spec.rb

  describe 'Blogs API' do

    path '/blogs/{blog_id}/comments' do

      post 'Creates a comment' do

        response 422, 'invalid request' do
          schema '$ref' => '#/components/schemas/errors_object'
    ...
  end

  ```


  ### Response headers ###


  In Rswag, you could use `header` method inside the response block to specify
  header objects for this response. 

  Rswag will validate your response headers with those header objects and inject
  them into the generated swagger file:


  ```ruby

  # spec/integration/comments_spec.rb

  describe 'Blogs API' do

    path '/blogs/{blog_id}/comments' do

      post 'Creates a comment' do

        response 422, 'invalid request' do
          header 'X-Rate-Limit-Limit', type: :integer, description: 'The number of allowed requests in the current period'
          header 'X-Rate-Limit-Remaining', type: :integer, description: 'The number of remaining requests in the current period'
    ...
  end

  ```


  ### Response examples ###


  You can provide custom response examples to the generated swagger file by
  calling the method `examples` inside the response block:

  However, auto generated example responses are now enabled by default in rswag.
  See below.

  ```ruby

  # spec/integration/blogs_spec.rb

  describe 'Blogs API' do

    path '/blogs/{blog_id}' do

      get 'Retrieves a blog' do

        response 200, 'blog found' do
          examples 'application/json' => {
              id: 1,
              title: 'Hello world!',
              content: '...'
            }
    ...
  end

  ```



  ### Enable auto generation examples from responses ###



  To enable examples generation from responses add callback above run_test!
  like:


  ```

  after do |example|
    example.metadata[:response][:examples] = { 'application/json' => JSON.parse(response.body, symbolize_names: true) }
  end

  ```


  You need to disable --dry-run option for Rspec > 3


  <!-- This is now enabled by default in rswag. 

  You need to set the ``` config.swagger_dry_run = false``` value in the
  spec/spec_helper.rb file.

  This is one of the more powerful features of rswag. When rswag runs your
  integration test suite via ```bundle exec rspec```, it will capture the
  request and response bodies and output those values in the examples section.

  These integration tests are usually written with ```let``` variables for post
  body parameters, and since its an integration test the service is returning
  actual values. 

  We might as well re-use these values and embed them into the generated swagger
  to provide a more real world example for request/response examples. -->


  Add to config/environments/test.rb:

  ```ruby

  RSpec.configure do |config|
    config.swagger_dry_run = false
  end

  ```


  #### Running tests without documenting ####


  If you want to use Rswag for testing without adding it to you swagger docs,
  you can provide the document tag:

  ```ruby

  describe 'Blogs API' do
    path '/blogs/{blog_id}' do
      get 'Retrieves a blog' do
        # documentation is now disabled for this response only
        response 200, 'blog found', document: false do
          ...
  ```


  You can also reenable documentation for specific responses only:

  ```ruby

  # documentation is now disabled

  describe 'Blogs API', document: false do
    path '/blogs/{blog_id}' do
      get 'Retrieves a blog' do
        # documentation is reenabled for this response only
        response 200, 'blog found', document: true do
          ...
        end

        response 401, 'special case' do
          ...
        end
  ```


  ##### rswag helper methods #####

  <!-- 

  There are some helper methods to help with documenting request bodies. 

  ```ruby

  describe 'Blogs API', type: :request, swagger_doc: 'v1/swagger.json' do
    let(:api_key) { 'fake_key' }

    path '/blogs' do
      post 'Creates a blog' do
        tags 'Blogs'
        description 'Creates a new blog from provided data'
        operationId 'createBlog'
        consumes 'application/json'
        produces 'application/json'

        request_body_json schema: { '$ref' => '#/components/schemas/blog' },
                          examples: :blog

        request_body_text_plain
        request_body_xml schema: { '$ref' => '#/components/schemas/blog' }

        let(:blog) { { blog: { title: 'foo', content: 'bar' } } }

        response '201', 'blog created' do
          schema '$ref' => '#/components/schemas/blog'
          run_test!
        end

        response '422', 'invalid request' do
          schema '$ref' => '#/components/schemas/errors_object'
          let(:blog) { { blog: { title: 'foo' } } }

          run_test! do |response|
            expect(response.body).to include("can't be blank")
          end
        end
      end
    end
  end    

  ```


  In the above example, we see methods ```request_body_json```
  ```request_body_plain``` ```request_body_xml```.

  These methods can be used to describe json, plain text and xml body. They are
  just wrapper methods to setup posting JSON, plain text or xml into your
  endpoint.

  The simplest most common usage is for json formatted body to use the schema:
  to specify the location of the schema for the request body

  and the examples: :blog which will create a named example "blog" under the
  "requestBody / content / application/json / examples" section.

  Again, documenting request response examples changed in Open API 3.0. The
  example above would generate a swagger.json snippet that looks like this:


  ```json
          ... 
          {"requestBody": {
            "required": true,
            "content": {
              "application/json": {
                "examples": {
                  "blog": {  // takes the name from  examples: :blog above
                    "value": {  //this is open api 3.0 structure -> https://swagger.io/docs/specification/adding-examples/
                      "blog": { // here is the actual JSON payload that is submitted to the service, and shows up in swagger UI as an example
                        "title": "foo",
                        "content": "bar"
                      }
                    }
                  }
                },
                "schema": {
                  "$ref": "#/components/schemas/blog"
                }
              },
              "test/plain": {
                "schema": {
                  "type": "string"
                }
              },
              "application/xml": {
                "schema": {
                  "$ref": "#/components/schemas/blog"
                }
              }
            }
          },
          }
  ```


  *NOTE:* for this example request body to work in the tests properly, you need
  to ``let`` a variable named *blog*. 

  The variable with the matching name (blog in this case) is eval-ed and
  captured to be placed in the examples section.

  This ```let``` value is used in the integration test to run the test AND
  captured and injected into the requestBody section. 


  ##### rswag response examples #####


  In the same way that requestBody examples can be captured and injected into
  the swagger output, response examples can also be captured.

  Using the above example, when the integration test is run - the swagger would
  include the following snippet providing more useful real world examples

  capturing the response from the execution of the integration test. Again 3.0
  swagger changed the structure of how these are documented.


  ```json
         ...  "responses": {
            "201": {
              "description": "blog created",
              "content": {
                "application/json": {
                  "example": {
                    "id": 1,
                    "title": "foo",
                    "content": "bar",
                    "thumbnail": null
                  },
                  "schema": {
                    "$ref": "#/components/schemas/blog"
                  }
                }
              }
            },
            "422": {
              "description": "invalid request",
              "content": {
                "application/json": {
                  "example": {
                    "errors": {
                      "content": [
                        "can't be blank"
                      ]
                    }
                  },
                  "schema": {
                    "$ref": "#/components/schemas/errors_object"
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }
  ```
   -->
  ### Route Prefix for Swagger JSON Endpoints ###


  The functionality to expose Swagger files, such as those generated by
  rswag-specs, as JSON endpoints is implemented as a Rails Engine. As with any
  Engine, you can change it's mount prefix in _routes.rb_:


  ```ruby

  TestApp::Application.routes.draw do
    ...

    mount Rswag::Api::Engine => 'your-custom-prefix'
  end

  ```


  Assuming a Swagger file exists at &lt;swagger_root&gt;/v1/swagger.json, this
  configuration would expose the file as the following JSON endpoint:


  ```

  GET http://<hostname>/your-custom-prefix/v1/swagger.json

  ```


  ### Root Location for Swagger Files ###


  You can adjust this in the _rswag_api.rb_ initializer that's installed with
  __rspec-api__:


  ```ruby

  Rswag::Api.configure do |c|
    c.swagger_root = Rails.root.to_s + '/your-custom-folder-name'
    ...
  end

  ```


  __NOTE__: If you're using rswag-specs to generate Swagger files, you'll want
  to ensure they both use the same &lt;swagger_root&gt;. The reason for separate
  settings is to maintain independence between the two gems. For example, you
  could install rswag-api independently and create your Swagger files manually.


  ### Dynamic Values for Swagger JSON ##


  There may be cases where you need to add dynamic values to the Swagger JSON
  that's returned by rswag-api. For example, you may want to provide an explicit
  host name. Rather than hardcoding it, you can configure a filter that's
  executed prior to serializing every Swagger document:


  ```ruby

  Rswag::Api.configure do |c|
    ...

    c.swagger_filter = lambda { |swagger, env| swagger['host'] = env['HTTP_HOST'] }
  end

  ```


  Note how the filter is passed the rack env for the current request. This
  provides a lot of flexibilty. For example, you can assign the "host" property
  (as shown) or you could inspect session information or an Authorization header
  and remove operations based on user permissions.


  ### Custom Headers for Swagger Files ###


  You can specify custom headers for serving your generated Swagger JSON. For
  example you may want to force a specific charset for the 'Content-Type'
  header. You can configure a hash of headers to be sent with the request:


  ```ruby

  Rswag::Api.configure do |c|
    ...
    
    c.swagger_headers = { 'Content-Type' => 'application/json; charset=UTF-8' }
  end

  ```


  Take care when overriding Content-Type if you serve both YAML and JSON files
  as it will no longer switch the Content-Type header correctly.



  ### Enable Swagger Endpoints for swagger-ui ###


  You can update the _rswag-ui.rb_ initializer, installed with rswag-ui, to
  specify which Swagger endpoints should be available to power the documentation
  UI. If you're using rswag-api, these should correspond to the Swagger
  endpoints it exposes. When the UI is rendered, you'll see these listed in a
  drop-down to the top right of the page:


  ```ruby

  Rswag::Ui.configure do |c|
    c.swagger_endpoint '/api-docs/v1/swagger.json', 'API V1 Docs'
    c.swagger_endpoint '/api-docs/v2/swagger.json', 'API V2 Docs'
  end

  ```


  ### Enable Simple Basic Auth for swagger-ui


  You can also update the _rswag-ui.rb_ initializer, installed with rswag-ui to
  specify a username and password should you want to keep your documentation
  private.


  ```ruby

  Rswag::Ui.configure do |c|
    c.basic_auth_enabled = true
    c.basic_auth_credentials 'username', 'password'
  end

  ```


  ### Route Prefix for the swagger-ui ###


  Similar to rswag-api, you can customize the swagger-ui path by changing it's
  mount prefix in _routes.rb_:


  ```ruby

  TestApp::Application.routes.draw do
    ...

    mount Rswag::Api::Engine => 'api-docs'
    mount Rswag::Ui::Engine => 'your-custom-prefix'
  end

  ```


  ### Customizing the swagger-ui ###


  The swagger-ui provides several options for customizing it's behavior, all of
  which are documented here
  https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/tree/2.x#swaggerui. If you need to
  tweak these or customize the overall look and feel of your swagger-ui, then
  you'll need to provide your own version of index.html. You can do this with
  the following generator.


  ```ruby

  rails g rswag:ui:custom


  ```


  This will add a local version that you can modify at
  _app/views/rswag/ui/home/index.html.erb_


  ### Serve UI Assets Directly from your Web Server


  Rswag ships with an embedded version of the
  [swagger-ui](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui), which is a static
  collection of JavaScript and CSS files. These assets are served by the
  rswag-ui middleware. However, for optimal performance you may want to serve
  them directly from your web server (e.g. Apache or NGINX). To do this, you'll
  need to copy them to the web server root. This is the "public" folder in a
  typical Rails application.


  ```

  bundle exec rake rswag:ui:copy_assets[public/api-docs]

  ```


  __NOTE:__: The provided subfolder MUST correspond to the UI mount prefix -
  "api-docs" by default.



  Notes to test swagger output locally with swagger editor

  ```

  docker pull swaggerapi/swagger-editor

  ```

  ```

  docker run -d -p 80:8080 swaggerapi/swagger-editor

  ```

  This will run the swagger editor in the docker daemon and can be accessed 

  at ```http://localhost```. From here, you can use the UI to load the generated
  swagger.json to validate the output.

drewish/rspec-rails-swagger: "# RSpec Rails Swagger\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/drewish/rspec-rails-swagger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/drewish/rspec-rails-swagger)\n[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/drewish/rspec-rails-swagger/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/drewish/rspec-rails-swagger)\n\nThis gem helps you generate Swagger docs by using RSpec to document the paths.\nYou execute a command to run the tests and generate the `.yaml` or `.json` output.\nRunning the tests ensures that your API and docs are in agreement, and generates\noutput that can be saved as response examples.\n\nThe design of this was heavily influenced by the awesome [swagger_rails gem](https://github.com/domaindrivendev/swagger_rails).\n\n## Setup\n\nAdd the gem to your Rails app's `Gemfile`:\n```rb\ngroup :development, :test do\n  gem 'rspec-rails-swagger'\nend\n```\n\nUpdate your bundle:\n```\nbundle install\n```\n\nIf you don't have a `spec/rails_helper.rb` file:\n```\nrails generate rspec:install\n```\n\nCreate the `spec/swagger_helper.rb` file:\n```\nrails generate rspec:swagger_install\n```\n\n## Documenting Your API\n\nNow you can edit `spec/swagger_helper.rb` and start filling in the top level\nSwagger documentation, e.g. basePath, [definitions](http://swagger.io/specification/#definitionsObject),\n[parameters](http://swagger.io/specification/#parametersDefinitionsObject),\n[tags](http://swagger.io/specification/#tagObject), etc.\n\nYou can use the generator to create a spec to documentation a controller:\n\n```\nrails generate rspec:swagger PostsController\n```\n\nThat will create a `spec/requests/posts_spec.rb` file with the paths, operations\nand some default requests filled in. With the structure in place you should only\nneed to add `before` calls to create records and then update the `let`s to\nreturn the appropriate values.\n\n## Generate the JSON or YAML\n\nTo create the Swagger files use the rake task:\n\n```\nbundle exec rake swagger\n```\n\nNow you can use Swagger UI or the renderer of your choice to display the\nformatted documentation. [swagger_engine](https://github.com/batdevis/swagger_engine)\nworks pretty well and supports multiple documents.\n\n## RSpec DSL\n\nThe DSL follows the hierarchy of the Swagger Schema:\n\n- [Paths Object](http://swagger.io/specification/#paths-object-29)\n  - [Path Item Object](http://swagger.io/specification/#path-item-object-32)\n    - [Parameter Object](http://swagger.io/specification/#parameter-object-44)s (Optional)\n    - [Operation Object](http://swagger.io/specification/#operation-object-36)\n      - [Parameter Object](http://swagger.io/specification/#parameter-object-44)s (Optional)\n      - [Responses Object](http://swagger.io/specification/#responses-object-54)\n        - [Response Object](http://swagger.io/specification/#response-object-58)\n          - [Example Object](http://swagger.io/specification/#example-object-65)s (Optional)\n\nHere's an example of a spec with comments to for the corresponding objects:\n\n```rb\nrequire 'swagger_helper'\n\n# Paths Object\nRSpec.describe \"Posts Controller\", type: :request do\n  before { Post.new.save }\n\n  # Path Item Object\n  path '/posts' do\n    # Operation Object\n    operation \"GET\", summary: \"fetch list\" do\n      # Response Object\n      response 200, description: \"successful\"\n    end\n  end\n\n  # Path Object\n  path '/posts/{post_id}' do\n    # Parameter Object\n    parameter \"post_id\", { in: :path, type: :integer }\n    let(:post_id) { 1 }\n\n    # Operation Object\n    get summary: \"fetch item\" do\n      # Response Object\n      response 200, description: \"success\"\n    end\n  end\n\n  # Path Post Object\n  path '/posts/' do\n    # Parameter Object for content type could be defined like:\n    consumes 'application/json'\n    # or:\n    parameter 'Content-Type', { in: :header, type: :string }\n    let(:'Content-Type') { 'application/json' }\n    # one of them would be considered\n\n    # authorization token in the header:\n    parameter 'Authorization', { in: :header, type: :string }\n    let(:'Authorization') { 'Bearer <token-here>' }\n\n    # Parameter Object\n    parameter \"post_id\", { in: :path, type: :integer }\n    let(:post_id) { 1 }\n\n    # Parameter Object for Body\n    parameter \"body\", { in: :body, required: true, schema: {\n      type: :object,\n        properties: {\n          title: { type: :string },\n          author_email: { type: :email }\n        }\n    }\n    let (:body) {\n      { post:\n        { title: 'my example',\n          author_email: 'me@example.com' }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\t# checkout http://swagger.io/specification/#parameter-object-44 for more information, options and details\n\n    # Operation Object\n    post summary: \"update an item\" do\n      # Response Object\n      response 200, description: \"success\"\n    end\n    # ...\nend\n```\n\n\n### Paths Object\nThese methods are available inside of an RSpec contexts with the `type: :request` tag.\n\n#### `path(template, attributes = {}, &block)`\nDefines a new Path Item.\n\nThe `attributes` parameter accepts:\n- `swagger_doc` a key in `RSpec.configuration.swagger_docs` that determines\n  which file the path belongs in.\n- `tags` with an array of tags that will be applied to the child Operations.\n\nYou can also provide a default file and tags by setting them on a parent RSpec\ncontext block:\n```rb\nRSpec.describe \"Sample Requests\", type: :request do\n  # The swagger_doc will be used as a default for the paths defined within the\n  # context block. Similarly, the tags will be merged with those set on paths\n  # defined within them.\n  context \"setting defaults\", swagger_doc: 'default_document.json', tags: [:context_tag] do\n    path '/posts', swagger_doc: 'overridden_document.yaml' tags: ['path_tag'] do\n      operation \"GET\", summary: \"fetch list\" do\n        produces 'application/json'\n        tags 'operation_tag'\n\n        response(200, { description: \"successful\" })\n      end\n    end\n  end\nend\n```\nThe `GET /posts` operation in this example will be saved in the `'overridden_document.yaml'`\nfile and tagged with `[\"context_tag\", \"path_tag\", \"operation_tag\"]`.\n\n\n### Path Item Object\nThese methods are available inside of blocks passed to the `path` method.\n\n#### `operation(method, attributes = {}, &block)`\nDefines a new Operation Object. The `method` is case insensitive.\n\nThe `attributes` parameter accepts:\n- `tags` with an array of tags. These will be merged with tags passed to the\n  Path Item or `tags` method inside the Operation's block.\n\n#### `delete(attributes = {}, &block)`\nAlias for `operation(:delete, attributes, block)`.\n\n#### `get(attributes = {}, &block)`\nAlias for `operation(:get, attributes, block)`.\n\n#### `head(attributes = {}, &block)`\nAlias for `operation(:head, attributes, block)`.\n\n#### `options(attributes = {}, &block)`\nAlias for `operation(:options, attributes, block)`.\n\n#### `patch(attributes = {}, &block)`\nAlias for `operation(:patch, attributes, block)`.\n\n#### `post(attributes = {}, &block)`\nAlias for `operation(:post, attributes, block)`.\n\n#### `put(attributes = {}, &block)`\nAlias for `operation(:put, attributes, block)`.\n\n\n### Parameters\nThese methods are available inside of blocks passed to the `path` or `operation` method.\n\n#### `parameter(name, attributes = {})`\nDefines a new Parameter Object. You can define the parameter inline:\n```rb\nparameter :callback_url, in: :query, type: :string, required: true\n```\n\nOr, via reference:\n```rb\nparameter ref: \"#/parameters/site_id\"\n```\n\nValues for the parameters are set using `let`:\n```rb\npost summary: \"create\" do\n  parameter \"body\", in: :body, schema: { foo: :bar }\n  let(:body) { { post: { title: 'asdf', body: \"blah\" } } }\n  # ...\nend\n```\n\n\n### Operation Object\nThese methods are available inside of blocks passed to the `operation` method.\n\n#### `consumes(*mime_types)`\nUse this to add MIME types that are specific to the operation. They will be merged\nwith the Swagger Object's consumes field.\n```rb\nconsumes 'application/json', 'application/xml'\n```\n\n#### `produces(*mime_types)`\nUse this to add MIME types that are specific to the operation. They will be merged\nwith the Swagger Object's consumes field.\n```rb\nproduces 'application/json', 'application/xml'\n```\n\n#### `response(status_code, attributes = {}, &block)`\nDefines a new Response Object. `status_code` must be between 1 and 599. `attributes`\nmust include a `description`.\n\n#### `tags(*tags)`\nAdds operation specific tags.\n```rb\ntags :accounts, :pets\n```\n\nYou can also provide tags through the RSpec context block and/or `path` method:\n```rb\nRSpec.describe \"Sample Requests\", type: :request, tags: [:context_tag] do\n  path '/posts', tags: ['path_tag'] do\n    operation \"GET\", summary: \"fetch list\" do\n      produces 'application/json'\n      tags 'operation_tag'\n\n      response(200, { description: \"successful\" })\n    end\n  end\nend\n```\nThese tags will be merged with those of the operation. The `GET /posts` operation\nin this example will be tagged with `[\"context_tag\", \"path_tag\", \"operation_tag\"]`.\n\n\n### Response Object\nThese methods are available inside of blocks passed to the `response` method.\n\n#### `capture_example()`\nThis method will capture the response body from the test and create an Example\nObject for the Response.\n\nYou could also set this in an RSpec context block if you'd like examples for\nmultiple operations or paths:\n```rb\ndescribe 'Connections', type: :request, capture_examples: true do\n  # Any requests in this block will capture example responses\nend\n```\n\n#### `schema(definition)`\nSets the schema field for the Response Object. You can define it inline:\n```rb\nschema(\n  type: :array,\n  items: {\n    type: :object,\n    properties: {\n      id: { type: :string },\n      name: { type: :string },\n    },\n  }\n)\n```\n\nOr, by reference:\n```rb\nschema ref: '#/definitions/Account'\n```\n"

  ![flasgger](docs/flasgger.png)


  Flasgger is a Flask extension to **extract
  [OpenAPI-Specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#operation-object)**
  from all Flask views registered in your API.


  Flasgger also comes with **[SwaggerUI](http://swagger.io/swagger-ui/)
  embedded** so you can access
  [http://localhost:5000/apidocs](localhost:5000/apidocs) and visualize and
  interact with your API resources.


  Flasgger also **provides validation** of the incoming data, using the same
  specification it can validates if the data received as as a POST, PUT, PATCH
  is valid against the schema defined using **YAML**, **Python dictionaries** or
  **Marshmallow Schemas**.


  Flasgger can work with simple function views or MethodViews using docstring as
  specification, or using `@swag_from` decorator to get specification from
  **YAML** or **dict** and also provides **SwaggerView** which can use
  **Marshmallow Schemas**  as specification.


  Flasgger is compatible with `Flask-RESTful` so you can use `Resources` and
  `swag` specifications together, take a look at [restful
  example.](examples/restful.py)


  Flasgger also supports `Marshmallow APISpec` as base template for
  specification, if you are using APISPec from Marshmallow take a look at
  [apispec example.](examples/apispec_example.py)

  # Getting started


  ## Using docstrings as specification


  Create a file called for example `colors.py`


  ```python

  from flask import Flask, jsonify

  from flasgger import Swagger


  app = Flask(__name__)

  swagger = Swagger(app)


  @app.route('/colors/<palette>/')

  def colors(palette):
      """Example endpoint returning a list of colors by palette
      This is using docstrings for specifications.
      ---
      parameters:
        - name: palette
          in: path
          type: string
          enum: ['all', 'rgb', 'cmyk']
          required: true
          default: all
      definitions:
        Palette:
          type: object
          properties:
            palette_name:
              type: array
              items:
                $ref: '#/definitions/Color'
        Color:
          type: string
      responses:
        200:
          description: A list of colors (may be filtered by palette)
          schema:
            $ref: '#/definitions/Palette'
          examples:
            rgb: ['red', 'green', 'blue']
      """
      all_colors = {
          'cmyk': ['cian', 'magenta', 'yellow', 'black'],
          'rgb': ['red', 'green', 'blue']
      }
      if palette == 'all':
          result = all_colors
      else:
          result = {palette: all_colors.get(palette)}

      return jsonify(result)

  app.run(debug=True)

  ```


  Now run:


  ```

  python colors.py

  ```


  And go to: [http://localhost:5000/apidocs/](http://localhost:5000/apidocs/)


  You should get:


  ![colors](docs/colors.png)


  ## Using external YAML files


  Save a new file `colors.yml`


  ```yaml

  Example endpoint returning a list of colors by palette

  In this example the specification is taken from external YAML file

  ---

  parameters:
    - name: palette
      in: path
      type: string
      enum: ['all', 'rgb', 'cmyk']
      required: true
      default: all
  definitions:
    Palette:
      type: object
      properties:
        palette_name:
          type: array
          items:
            $ref: '#/definitions/Color'
    Color:
      type: string
  responses:
    200:
      description: A list of colors (may be filtered by palette)
      schema:
        $ref: '#/definitions/Palette'
      examples:
        rgb: ['red', 'green', 'blue']
  ```



  lets use the same example changing only the view function.


  ```python

  from flasgger import swag_from


  @app.route('/colors/<palette>/')

  @swag_from('colors.yml')

  def colors(palette):
      ...
  ```


  If you do not want to use the decorator you can use the docstring `file:`
  shortcut.


  ```python

  @app.route('/colors/<palette>/')

  def colors(palette):
      """
      file: colors.yml
      """
      ...
  ```



  ## Using dictionaries as raw specs


  Create a Python dictionary as:


  ```python

  specs_dict = {
    "parameters": [
      {
        "name": "palette",
        "in": "path",
        "type": "string",
        "enum": [
          "all",
          "rgb",
          "cmyk"
        ],
        "required": "true",
        "default": "all"
      }
    ],
    "definitions": {
      "Palette": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "palette_name": {
            "type": "array",
            "items": {
              "$ref": "#/definitions/Color"
            }
          }
        }
      },
      "Color": {
        "type": "string"
      }
    },
    "responses": {
      "200": {
        "description": "A list of colors (may be filtered by palette)",
        "schema": {
          "$ref": "#/definitions/Palette"
        },
        "examples": {
          "rgb": [
            "red",
            "green",
            "blue"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }

  ```


  Now take the same function and use the dict in the place of YAML file.


  ```python

  @app.route('/colors/<palette>/')

  @swag_from(specs_dict)

  def colors(palette):
      """Example endpoint returning a list of colors by palette
      In this example the specification is taken from specs_dict
      """
      ...
  ```


  ## Using Marshmallow Schemas


  > FIRST: `pip install marshmallow apispec`


  ```python

  from flask import Flask, jsonify

  from flasgger import Swagger, SwaggerView, Schema, fields



  class Color(Schema):
      name = fields.Str()

  class Palette(Schema):
      pallete_name = fields.Str()
      colors = fields.Nested(Color, many=True)

  class PaletteView(SwaggerView):
      parameters = [
          {
              "name": "palette",
              "in": "path",
              "type": "string",
              "enum": ["all", "rgb", "cmyk"],
              "required": True,
              "default": "all"
          }
      ]
      responses = {
          200: {
              "description": "A list of colors (may be filtered by palette)",
              "schema": Palette
          }
      }

      def get(self, palette):
          """
          Colors API using schema
          This example is using marshmallow schemas
          """
          all_colors = {
              'cmyk': ['cian', 'magenta', 'yellow', 'black'],
              'rgb': ['red', 'green', 'blue']
          }
          if palette == 'all':
              result = all_colors
          else:
              result = {palette: all_colors.get(palette)}
          return jsonify(result)

  app = Flask(__name__)

  swagger = Swagger(app)


  app.add_url_rule(
      '/colors/<palette>',
      view_func=PaletteView.as_view('colors'),
      methods=['GET']
  )


  app.run(debug=True)


  ```


  > NOTE: take a look at `examples/validation.py` for a more complete example.



  > NOTE: when catching arguments in path rule always use explicit types, bad:
  ``/api/<username>`` good: ``/api/<string:username>``



  ## Using **Flask RESTful** Resources


  Flasgger is compatible with Flask-RESTful you only need to install `pip
  install flask-restful` and then:


  ```python


  from flask import Flask

  from flasgger import Swagger

  from flask_restful import Api, Resource


  app = Flask(__name__)

  api = Api(app)

  swagger = Swagger(app)


  class Username(Resource):
      def get(self, username):
         """
         This examples uses FlaskRESTful Resource
         It works also with swag_from, schemas and spec_dict
         ---
         parameters:
           - in: path
             name: username
             type: string
             required: true
         responses:
           200:
             description: A single user item
             schema:
               id: User
               properties:
                 username:
                   type: string
                   description: The name of the user
                   default: Steven Wilson
          """
          return {'username': username}, 200


  api.add_resource(Username, '/username/<username>')


  app.run(debug=True)


  ```


  ## Auto-parsing external YAML docs and `MethodView`s


  Flasgger can be configured to auto-parse external YAML API docs.  [Set a
  `doc_dir`](https://github.com/rochacbruno/flasgger/blob/aaef05c17cc559d01b7436211093463642eb6ae2/examples/parsed_view_func.py#L16)
  in your `app.config['SWAGGER']` and Swagger will load API docs by looking in
  `doc_dir` for YAML files stored by endpoint-name and method-name.  For
  example, `'doc_dir': './examples/docs/'` and a file
  `./examples/docs/items/get.yml` will provide a Swagger doc for `ItemsView`
  method `get`.


  Additionally, when using **Flask RESTful** per above, by passing `parse=True`
  when constructing `Swagger`, Flasgger will use 
  `flask_restful.reqparse.RequestParser`, locate all `MethodView`s and parsed
  and validated data will be stored in `flask.request.parsed_data`.


  ## Handling multiple http methods and routes for a single function


  You can separate specifications by endpoint or methods


  ```python

  from flasgger.utils import swag_from


  @app.route('/api/<string:username>', endpoint='with_user_name',
  methods=['PUT', 'GET'])

  @app.route('/api/', endpoint='without_user_name')

  @swag_from('path/to/external_file.yml', endpoint='with_user_name')

  @swag_from('path/to/external_file_no_user_get.yml',
  endpoint='without_user_name', methods=['GET'])

  @swag_from('path/to/external_file_no_user_put.yml',
  endpoint='without_user_name', methods=['PUT'])

  def fromfile_decorated(username=None):
      if not username:
          return "No user!"
      return jsonify({'username': username})
  ```


  And the same can be achieved with multiple methods in a `MethodView` or
  `SwaggerView` by

  registering the `url_rule` many times. Take a look at `examples/example_app`



  # Use the same data to validate your API POST body.


  Setting `swag_from`'s _validation_ parameter to `True` will validate incoming
  data automatically:


  ```python

  from flasgger import swag_from


  @swag_from('defs.yml', validation=True)

  def post():
      # if not validate returns ValidationError response with status 400
      # also returns the validation message.
  ```


  Using `swagger.validate` annotation is also possible:


  ```python

  from flasgger import Swagger


  swagger = Swagger(app)


  @swagger.validate('UserSchema')

  def post():
      '''
      file: defs.yml
      '''
      # if not validate returns ValidationError response with status 400
      # also returns the validation message.
  ```


  Yet you can call `validate` manually:


  ```python

  from flasgger import swag_from, validate


  @swag_from('defs.yml')

  def post():
      validate(request.json, 'UserSchema', 'defs.yml')
      # if not validate returns ValidationError response with status 400
      # also returns the validation message.
  ```


  It is also possible to define `validation=True` in `SwaggerView` and also use

  `specs_dict` for validation.


  Take a look at `examples/validation.py` for more information.


  All validation options can be found at
  http://json-schema.org/latest/json-schema-validation.html


  ### Custom validation


  By default Flasgger will use
  [python-jsonschema](https://python-jsonschema.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

  to perform validation.


  Custom validation functions are supported as long as they meet the
  requirements:
   - take two, and only two, positional arguments:
      - the data to be validated as the first; and
      - the schema to validate against as the second argument
   - raise any kind of exception when validation fails.

  Any return value is discarded.



  Providing the function to the Swagger instance will make it the default:


  ```python

  from flasgger import Swagger


  swagger = Swagger(app, validation_function=my_validation_function)

  ```


  Providing the function as parameter of `swag_from` or `swagger.validate`

  annotations or directly to the `validate` function will force it's use

  over the default validation function for Swagger:


  ```python

  from flasgger import swag_from


  @swag_from('spec.yml', validation=True, validation_function=my_function)

  ...

  ```


  ```python

  from flasgger import Swagger


  swagger = Swagger(app)


  @swagger.validate('Pet', validation_function=my_function)

  ...

  ```


  ```python

  from flasgger import validate


  ...

      validate(
          request.json, 'Pet', 'defs.yml', validation_function=my_function)
  ```


  ### Validation Error handling


  By default Flasgger will handle validation errors by aborting the

  request with a 400 BAD REQUEST response with the error message.


  A custom validation error handling function can be provided to

  supersede default behavior as long as it meets the requirements:
   - take three, and only three, positional arguments:
      - the error raised as the first;
      - the data which failed validation as the second; and
      - the schema used in to validate as the third argument


  Providing the function to the Swagger instance will make it the default:


  ```python

  from flasgger import Swagger


  swagger = Swagger(app, validation_error_handler=my_handler)

  ```


  Providing the function as parameter of `swag_from` or `swagger.validate`

  annotations or directly to the `validate` function will force it's use

  over the default validation function for Swagger:


  ```python

  from flasgger import swag_from


  @swag_from(
      'spec.yml', validation=True, validation_error_handler=my_handler)
  ...

  ```


  ```python

  from flasgger import Swagger


  swagger = Swagger(app)


  @swagger.validate('Pet', validation_error_handler=my_handler)

  ...

  ```


  ```python

  from flasgger import validate


  ...

      validate(
          request.json, 'Pet', 'defs.yml',
          validation_error_handler=my_handler)
  ```


  Examples of use of a custom validation error handler function can be

  found at [example
  validation_error_handler.py](examples/validation_error_handler.py)


  # Get defined schemas as python dictionaries


  You may wish to use schemas you defined in your Swagger specs as dictionaries

  without replicating the specification. For that you can use the `get_schema`

  method:


  ```python

  from flask import Flask, jsonify

  from flasgger import Swagger, swag_from


  app = Flask(__name__)

  swagger = Swagger(app)


  @swagger.validate('Product')

  def post():
      """
      post endpoint
      ---
      tags:
        - products
      parameters:
        - name: body
          in: body
          required: true
          schema:
            id: Product
            required:
              - name
            properties:
              name:
                type: string
                description: The product's name.
                default: "Guarana"
      responses:
        200:
          description: The product inserted in the database
          schema:
            $ref: '#/definitions/Product'
      """
      rv = db.insert(request.json)
      return jsonify(rv)

  ...


  product_schema = swagger.get_schema('product')

  ```


  This method returns a dictionary which contains the Flasgger schema id,

  all defined parameters and a list of required parameters.


  # HTML sanitizer


  By default Flasgger will try to sanitize the content in YAML definitions

  replacing every ```\n``` with ```<br>``` but you can change this behaviour

  setting another kind of sanitizer.


  ```python

  from flasgger import Swagger, NO_SANITIZER


  app =Flask()

  swagger = Swagger(app, sanitizer=NO_SANITIZER)

  ```


  You can write your own sanitizer


  ```python

  swagger = Swagger(app, sanitizer=lambda text: do_anything_with(text))

  ```


  There is also a Markdown parser available, if you want to be able to render

  Markdown in your specs description use **MK_SANITIZER**



  # Swagger UI and templates


  You can override the `templates/flasgger/index.html` in your application and

  this template will be the `index.html` for SwaggerUI. Use
  `flasgger/ui2/templates/index.html`

  as base for your customization.


  Flasgger supports Swagger UI versions 2 and 3, The version 3 is still
  experimental but you

  can try setting `app.config['SWAGGER']['uiversion']`.


  ```python

  app = Flask(__name__)

  app.config['SWAGGER'] = {
      'title': 'My API',
      'uiversion': 3
  }

  swagger = Swagger(app)


  ```


  # OpenAPI 3.0 Support


  There is experimental support for OpenAPI 3.0 that should work when using
  SwaggerUI 3. To use OpenAPI 3.0, set `app.config['SWAGGER']['openapi']` to a
  version that the current SwaggerUI 3 supports such as `'3.0.2'`.


  For an example of this that uses `callbacks` and `requestBody`, see the
  [callbacks example](examples/callbacks.py).


  ## Externally loading Swagger UI and jQuery JS/CSS


  Starting with Flasgger 0.9.2 you can specify external URL locations for
  loading the JavaScript and CSS for the Swagger and jQuery libraries loaded in
  the Flasgger default templates.  If the configuration properties below are
  omitted, Flasgger will serve static versions it includes - these versions may
  be older than the current Swagger UI v2 or v3 releases.


  The following example loads Swagger UI and jQuery versions from unpkg.com:


  ```

  swagger_config = Swagger.DEFAULT_CONFIG

  swagger_config['swagger_ui_bundle_js'] =
  '//unpkg.com/swagger-ui-dist@3/swagger-ui-bundle.js'

  swagger_config['swagger_ui_standalone_preset_js'] =
  '//unpkg.com/swagger-ui-dist@3/swagger-ui-standalone-preset.js'

  swagger_config['jquery_js'] = '//unpkg.com/jquery@2.2.4/dist/jquery.min.js'

  swagger_config['swagger_ui_css'] =
  '//unpkg.com/swagger-ui-dist@3/swagger-ui.css'

  Swagger(app, config=swagger_config)

  ```


  # Initializing Flasgger with default data.


  You can start your Swagger spec with any default data providing a template:


  ```python

  template = {
    "swagger": "2.0",
    "info": {
      "title": "My API",
      "description": "API for my data",
      "contact": {
        "responsibleOrganization": "ME",
        "responsibleDeveloper": "Me",
        "email": "me@me.com",
        "url": "www.me.com",
      },
      "termsOfService": "http://me.com/terms",
      "version": "0.0.1"
    },
    "host": "mysite.com",  # overrides localhost:500
    "basePath": "/api",  # base bash for blueprint registration
    "schemes": [
      "http",
      "https"
    ],
    "operationId": "getmyData"
  }


  swagger = Swagger(app, template=template)


  ```


  And then the template is the default data unless some view changes it. You

  can also provide all your specs as template and have no views. Or views in

  external APP.


  ## Getting default data at runtime


  Sometimes you need to get some data at runtime depending on dynamic values ex:
  you want to check `request.is_secure` to decide if `schemes` will be `https`
  you can do that by using `LazyString`.


  ```py

  from flask import Flask

  from flasgger import, Swagger, LazyString, LazyJSONEncoder


  app = Flask(__init__)


  # Set the custom Encoder (Inherit it if you need to customize)

  app.json_encoder = LazyJSONEncoder



  template = dict(
      info={
          'title': LazyString(lambda: 'Lazy Title'),
          'version': LazyString(lambda: '99.9.9'),
          'description': LazyString(lambda: 'Hello Lazy World'),
          'termsOfService': LazyString(lambda: '/there_is_no_tos')
      },
      host=LazyString(lambda: request.host),
      schemes=[LazyString(lambda: 'https' if request.is_secure else 'http')],
      foo=LazyString(lambda: "Bar")
  )

  Swagger(app, template=template)


  ```


  The `LazyString` values will be evaluated only when `jsonify` encodes the
  value at runtime, so you have access to Flask `request, session, g, etc..` and
  also may want to access a database.


  ## Behind a reverse proxy


  Sometimes you're serving your swagger docs behind an reverse proxy (e.g.
  NGINX).  When following the [Flask
  guidance](http://flask.pocoo.org/snippets/35/),

  the swagger docs will load correctly, but the "Try it Out" button points to
  the wrong place.  This can be fixed with the following code:


  ```python

  from flask import Flask, request

  from flasgger import Swagger, LazyString, LazyJSONEncoder


  app = Flask(__name__)

  app.json_encoder = LazyJSONEncoder


  template = dict(swaggerUiPrefix=LazyString(lambda :
  request.environ.get('HTTP_X_SCRIPT_NAME', '')))

  swagger = Swagger(app, template=template)


  ``` 


  # Customize default configurations


  Custom configurations such as a different specs route or disabling Swagger UI
  can be provided to Flasgger:


  ```python

  swagger_config = {
      "headers": [
      ],
      "specs": [
          {
              "endpoint": 'apispec_1',
              "route": '/apispec_1.json',
              "rule_filter": lambda rule: True,  # all in
              "model_filter": lambda tag: True,  # all in
          }
      ],
      "static_url_path": "/flasgger_static",
      # "static_folder": "static",  # must be set by user
      "swagger_ui": True,
      "specs_route": "/apidocs/"
  }


  swagger = Swagger(app, config=swagger_config)


  ```


  ## Extracting Definitions


  Definitions can be extracted when `id` is found in spec, example:


  ```python

  from flask import Flask, jsonify

  from flasgger import Swagger


  app = Flask(__name__)

  swagger = Swagger(app)


  @app.route('/colors/<palette>/')

  def colors(palette):
      """Example endpoint returning a list of colors by palette
      ---
      parameters:
        - name: palette
          in: path
          type: string
          enum: ['all', 'rgb', 'cmyk']
          required: true
          default: all
      responses:
        200:
          description: A list of colors (may be filtered by palette)
          schema:
            id: Palette
            type: object
            properties:
              palette_name:
                type: array
                items:
                  schema:
                    id: Color
                    type: string
          examples:
            rgb: ['red', 'green', 'blue']
      """
      all_colors = {
          'cmyk': ['cian', 'magenta', 'yellow', 'black'],
          'rgb': ['red', 'green', 'blue']
      }
      if palette == 'all':
          result = all_colors
      else:
          result = {palette: all_colors.get(palette)}

      return jsonify(result)

  app.run(debug=True)

  ```


  In this example you do not have to pass `definitions` but need to add `id` to

  your schemas.

Generate beautiful API documentation, including a UI to explore and test operations, directly from your routes, controllers and models.\n\nIn addition to its [Swagger 2.0 and OpenAPI 3.0](http://swagger.io/specification/) generator, Swashbuckle also provides an embedded version of the awesome [swagger-ui](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui) that's powered by the generated Swagger JSON. This means you can complement your API with living documentation that's always in sync with the latest code. Best of all, it requires minimal coding and maintenance, allowing you to focus on building an awesome API.\n\nAnd that's not all ...\n\nOnce you have an API that can describe itself in Swagger, you've opened the treasure chest of Swagger-based tools including a client generator that can be targeted to a wide range of popular platforms.

Install the standard Nuget package into your ASP.NET Core application.\n\n    ```\n    Package Manager : Install-Package Swashbuckle.AspNetCore -Version 6.5.0\n    CLI : dotnet add package --version 6.5.0 Swashbuckle.AspNetCore\n    ```\n\n2. In the `ConfigureServices` method of `Startup.cs`, register the Swagger generator, defining one or more Swagger documents.\n\n    ```csharp\n    using Microsoft.OpenApi.Models;\n    ```\n    \n    ```csharp\n    services.AddMvc();\n\n    services.AddSwaggerGen(c =>\n    {\n        c.SwaggerDoc(\"v1\", new OpenApiInfo { Title = \"My API\", Version = \"v1\" });\n    });\n    ```\n\n3. Ensure your API actions and parameters are decorated with explicit \"Http\" and \"From\" bindings.\n\n    ```csharp\n    [HttpPost]\n    public void CreateProduct([FromBody]Product product)\n    ...\n    ```\n\n    ```csharp\n    [HttpGet]\n    public IEnumerable<Product> SearchProducts([FromQuery]string keywords)\n    ...\n    ```\n\n    _NOTE: If you omit the explicit parameter bindings, the generator will describe them as \"query\" params by default._\n\n4. In the `Configure` method,you should expose the generated Swagger as JSON endpoint(s) by one of following method:\n\n    - Add endpoints if you're using endpoint-based routing.\n\n    ```csharp\n    app.MapEndpoints(endpoints =>\n    {\n        // ...\n        endpoints.MapSwagger();\n    });\n    ```\n\n    - Insert middleware\n\n    ```csharp\n    app.UseSwagger();\n    ```\n\n    _At this point, you can spin up your application and view the generated Swagger JSON at \"/swagger/v1/swagger.json.\"_\n\n5. Optionally, insert the swagger-ui middleware if you want to expose interactive documentation, specifying the Swagger JSON endpoint(s) to power it from.\n\n    ```csharp\n    app.UseSwaggerUI(c =>\n    {\n        c.SwaggerEndpoint(\"v1/swagger.json\", \"My API V1\");\n    });\n    ```\n\n    _Now you can restart your application and check out the auto-generated, interactive docs at \"/swagger\"._\n\n# System.Text.Json (STJ) vs Newtonsoft #\n\nIn versions prior to `5.0.0`, Swashbuckle will generate Schema's (descriptions of the data types exposed by an API) based on the behavior of the *Newtonsoft* serializer. This made sense because that was the serializer that shipped with ASP.NET Core at the time. However, since version `3.0.0`, ASP.NET Core introduces a new serializer *System.Text.Json (STJ)* out-of-the-box, and if you want to continue using *Newtonsoft*, you need to install a separate package and explicitly opt-in. From Swashbuckle `5.0.0` and beyond a similar pattern is used. That is, out-of-the-box Swashbuckle will assume you're using the *STJ* serializer and generate Schema's based on its behavior. If you're using *Newtonsoft*, then you'll need to install a separate Swashbuckle package and explicitly opt-in. **This is a required step, regardless of which version of ASP.NET Core you're using**.\n\nIn summary ...\n\nIf you're using **System.Text.Json (STJ)**, then the setup described above will be sufficient, and *STJ* options/attributes will be automatically honored by the Swagger generator.\n\nIf you're using **Newtonsoft**, then you'll need to install a separate package and explicitly opt-in to ensure that *Newtonsoft* settings/attributes are automatically honored by the Swagger generator:\n\n```\nPackage Manager : Install-Package Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.Newtonsoft -Version 6.5.0\nCLI : dotnet add package --version 6.5.0 Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.Newtonsoft\n```\n\n```csharp\nservices.AddMvc();\n\nservices.AddSwaggerGen(c =>\n{\n    c.SwaggerDoc(\"v1\", new OpenApiInfo { Title = \"My API\", Version = \"v1\" });\n});\nservices.AddSwaggerGenNewtonsoftSupport(); // explicit opt-in - needs to be placed after AddSwaggerGen()\n```\n\n# Swashbuckle, ApiExplorer, and Routing #\n\nSwashbuckle relies heavily on `ApiExplorer`, the API metadata layer that ships with ASP.NET Core. If you're using the `AddMvc` helper to bootstrap the MVC stack, then ApiExplorer will be automatically registered and SB will work without issue. However, if you're using `AddMvcCore` for a more paired-down MVC stack, you'll need to explicitly add the ApiExplorer service:\n\n```csharp\nservices.AddMvcCore()\n    .AddApiExplorer();\n```\n\nAdditionally, if you are using _[conventional routing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/controllers/routing#conventional-routing)_ (as opposed to attribute routing), any controllers and the actions on those controllers that use conventional routing will not be represented in ApiExplorer, which means Swashbuckle won't be able to find those controllers and generate Swagger operations from them. For instance:\n\n```csharp\napp.UseMvc(routes =>\n{\n   // SwaggerGen won't find controllers that are routed via this technique.\n   routes.MapRoute(\"default\", \"{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}\");\n});\n```\n\nYou **must** use attribute routing for any controllers that you want represented in your Swagger document(s):\n\n```csharp\n[Route(\"example\")]\npublic class ExampleController : Controller\n{\n    [HttpGet(\"\")]\n    public IActionResult DoStuff() { /**/ }\n}\n```\nRefer to the [routing documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/controllers/routing) for more information.\n\n# Components #\n\nSwashbuckle consists of multiple components that can be used together or individually depending on your needs. At its core, there's a Swagger generator, middleware to expose it as JSON endpoints, and a packaged version of the [swagger-ui](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui). These 3 packages can be installed with the `Swashbuckle.AspNetCore` \"metapackage\" and will work together seamlessly (see [Getting Started](#getting-started)) to provide beautiful API docs that are automatically generated from your code.\n\nAdditionally, there's add-on packages (CLI tools, [an alternate UI](https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc) etc.) that you can optionally install and configure as needed.\n\n## \"Core\" Packages (i.e. installed via Swashbuckle.AspNetCore)\n\n|Package|Description|\n|---------|-----------|\n|Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.Swagger|Exposes Swagger JSON endpoints. It expects an implementation of `ISwaggerProvider` to be registered in the DI container, which it queries to retrieve `OpenAPIDocument(s)` that are then exposed as serialized JSON|\n|Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.SwaggerGen|Injects an implementation of `ISwaggerProvider` that can be used by the above component. This particular implementation generates `OpenApiDocument(s)` from your routes, controllers and models|\n|Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.SwaggerUI|Exposes an embedded version of the swagger-ui. You specify the API endpoints where it can obtain Swagger JSON, and it uses them to power interactive docs for your API|\n\n## Additional Packages ##\n\n|Package|Description|\n|---------|-----------|\n|Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.Annotations|Includes a set of custom attributes that can be applied to controllers, actions and models to enrich the generated Swagger|\n|Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.Cli|Provides a command line interface for retrieving Swagger directly from a startup assembly, and writing to file|\n|Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.ReDoc|Exposes an embedded version of the ReDoc UI (an alternative to swagger-ui)|\n\n## Community Packages ##\n\nThese packages are provided by the open-source community.\n\n|Package|Description|\n|---------|-----------|\n|[Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.Filters](https://github.com/mattfrear/Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.Filters)| Some useful Swashbuckle filters which add additional documentation, e.g. request and response examples, authorization information, etc. See its Readme for more details |\n|[Unchase.Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.Extensions](https://github.com/unchase/Unchase.Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.Extensions)| Some useful extensions (filters), which add additional documentation, e.g. hide PathItems for unaccepted roles, fix enums for client code generation, etc. See its Readme for more details |\n|[MicroElements.Swashbuckle.FluentValidation](https://github.com/micro-elements/MicroElements.Swashbuckle.FluentValidation)| Use FluentValidation rules instead of ComponentModel attributes to augment generated Swagger Schemas |\n|[MMLib.SwaggerForOcelot](https://github.com/Burgyn/MMLib.SwaggerForOcelot)| Aggregate documentations over microservices directly on Ocelot API Gateway |\n\n# Configuration & Customization #\n\nThe steps described above will get you up and running with minimal setup.

Custom routes MUST include the `{documentName}` parameter.\n\n```csharp\napp.UseSwagger(c =>\n{\n    c.RouteTemplate = \"api-docs/{documentName}/swagger.json\";\n})\n```\n\n_NOTE: If you're using the SwaggerUI middleware, you'll also need to update its configuration to reflect the new endpoints:_\n\n```csharp\napp.UseSwaggerUI(c =>\n{\n    c.SwaggerEndpoint(\"/api-docs/v1/swagger.json\", \"My API V1\");\n})\n```\n\n_NOTE: If you also need to update the relative path that the UI itself is available on, you'll need to follow the instructions found in [Change Relative Path to the UI](#change-relative-path-to-the-ui)._\n\n### Modify Swagger with Request Context ###\n\nIf you need to set some Swagger metadata based on the current request, you can configure a filter that's executed prior to serializing the document.\n\n```csharp\napp.UseSwagger(c =>\n{\n    c.PreSerializeFilters.Add((swagger, httpReq) =>\n    {\n        swagger.Servers = new List<OpenApiServer> { new OpenApiServer { Url = $\"{httpReq.Scheme}://{httpReq.Host.Value}\" } };\n    });\n});\n```\n\nThe `OpenApiDocument` and the current `HttpRequest` are both passed to the filter. This provides a lot of flexibility. For example, you can add an explicit API server based on the \"Host\" header (as shown), or you could inspect session information or an Authorization header and remove operations from the document based on user permissions.\n\n### Serialize Swagger in the 2.0 format ###\n\nBy default, Swashbuckle will generate and expose Swagger JSON in version 3.0 of the specification, officially called the OpenAPI Specification. However, to support backwards compatibility, you can opt to continue exposing it in the 2.0 format with the following option:\n\n```csharp\napp.UseSwagger(c =>\n{\n    c.SerializeAsV2 = true;\n});\n```\n\n### Working with Virtual Directories and Reverse Proxies ###\n\nVirtual directories and reverse proxies can cause issues for applications that generate links and redirects, particularly if the app returns *absolute* URLs based on the `Host` header and other information from the current request. To avoid these issues, Swashbuckle uses *relative* URLs where possible, and encourages their use when configuring the SwaggerUI and ReDoc middleware.\n\nFor example, to wire up the SwaggerUI middleware, you provide the URL to one or more OpenAPI/Swagger documents. This is the URL that the swagger-ui, a client-side application, will call to retrieve your API metadata. To ensure this works behind virtual directories and reverse proxies, you should express this relative to the `RoutePrefix` of the swagger-ui itself:\n\n```csharp\napp.UseSwaggerUI(c =>\n{\n    c.RoutePrefix = \"swagger\";\n    c.SwaggerEndpoint(\"v1/swagger.json\", \"My API V1\");\n});\n```\n\n_NOTE: In previous versions of the docs, you may have seen this expressed as a root-relative link (e.g. `/swagger/v1/swagger.json`). This won't work if your app is hosted on an IIS virtual directory or behind a proxy that trims the request path before forwarding. If you switch to the *page-relative* syntax shown above, it should work in all cases._\n\n## Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.SwaggerGen ##\n\n### Assign Explicit OperationIds ###\n\nIn Swagger, operations MAY be assigned an `operationId`. This ID MUST be unique among all operations described in the API. Tools and libraries (e.g. client generators) MAY use the operationId to uniquely identify an operation, therefore, it is RECOMMENDED to follow common programming naming conventions.\n\nAuto-generating an ID that matches these requirements, while also providing a name that would be meaningful in client libraries is a non-trivial task and so, Swashbuckle omits the `operationId` by default. However, if necessary, you can assign `operationIds` by decorating individual routes OR by providing a custom strategy.\n\n__Option 1) Decorate routes with a `Name` property__\n\n```csharp\n[HttpGet(\"{id}\", Name = \"GetProductById\")]\npublic IActionResult Get(int id) // operationId = \"GetProductById\"\n```\n\n__Option 2) Provide a custom strategy__\n\n```csharp\n// Startup.cs\nservices.AddSwaggerGen(c =>\n{\n    ...\n    \n    // Use method name as operationId\n    c.CustomOperationIds(apiDesc =>\n    {\n        return apiDesc.TryGetMethodInfo(out MethodInfo methodInfo) ? methodInfo.Name : null;\n    });\n})\n\n// ProductsController.cs\n[HttpGet(\"{id}\")]\npublic IActionResult GetProductById(int id) // operationId = \"GetProductById\"\n```\n\n_NOTE: With either approach, API authors are responsible for ensuring the uniqueness of `operationIds` across all Operations_\n\n### List Operation Responses ###\n\nBy default, Swashbuckle will generate a \"200\" response for each operation. If the action returns a response DTO, then this will be used to generate a schema for the response body. For example ...\n\n```csharp\n[HttpPost(\"{id}\")]\npublic Product GetById(int id)\n```\n\nWill produce the following response metadata:\n\n```\nresponses: {\n  200: {\n    description: \"Success\",\n    content: {\n      \"application/json\": {\n        schema: {\n          $ref: \"#/components/schemas/Product\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Explicit Responses ####\n\nIf you need to specify a different status code and/or additional responses, or your actions return `IActionResult` instead of a response DTO, you can explicitly describe responses with the `ProducesResponseTypeAttribute` that ships with ASP.NET Core. For example ...\n\n```csharp\n[HttpPost(\"{id}\")]\n[ProducesResponseType(typeof(Product), 200)]\n[ProducesResponseType(typeof(IDictionary<string, string>), 400)]\n[ProducesResponseType(500)]\npublic IActionResult GetById(int id)\n```\n\nWill produce the following response metadata:\n\n```\nresponses: {\n  200: {\n    description: \"Success\",\n    content: {\n      \"application/json\": {\n        schema: {\n          $ref: \"#/components/schemas/Product\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  400: {\n    description: \"Bad Request\",\n    content: {\n      \"application/json\": {\n        schema: {\n          type: \"object\",\n          additionalProperties: {\n            type: \"string\"\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  500: {\n    description: \"Server Error\",\n    content: {}\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Flag Required Parameters and Schema Properties ###\n\nIn a Swagger document, you can flag parameters and schema properties that are required for a request. If a parameter (top-level or property-based) is decorated with the `BindRequiredAttribute` or `RequiredAttribute`, then Swashbuckle will automatically flag it as a \"required\" parameter in the generated Swagger:\n\n```csharp\n// ProductsController.cs\npublic IActionResult Search([FromQuery, BindRequired]string keywords, [FromQuery]PagingParams pagingParams)\n{\n    if (!ModelState.IsValid)\n        return BadRequest(ModelState);\n    ...\n}\n\n// SearchParams.cs\npublic class PagingParams\n{\n    [Required]\n    public int PageNo { get; set; }\n\n    public int PageSize { get; set; }\n}\n```\n\nIn addition to parameters, Swashbuckle will also honor the `RequiredAttribute` when used in a model that's bound to the request body. In this case, the decorated properties will be flagged as \"required\" properties in the body description:\n\n```csharp\n// ProductsController.cs\npublic IActionResult Create([FromBody]Product product)\n{\n    if (!ModelState.IsValid)\n        return BadRequest(ModelState);\n    ...\n}\n\n// Product.cs\npublic class Product\n{\n    [Required]\n    public string Name { get; set; }\n\n    public string Description { get; set; }\n}\n```\n\n### Handle Forms and File Uploads ###\n\nThis controller will accept two form field values and one named file upload from the same form:\n\n```csharp\n[HttpPost]\npublic void UploadFile([FromForm]string description, [FromForm]DateTime clientDate, IFormFile file)\n```\n\n> Important note: As per the [ASP.NET Core docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/models/file-uploads?view=aspnetcore-3.1), you're not supposed to decorate `IFormFile` parameters with the `[FromForm]` attribute as the binding source is automatically inferred from the type. In fact, the inferred value is `BindingSource.FormFile` and if you apply the attribute it will be set to `BindingSource.Form` instead, which screws up `ApiExplorer`, the metadata component that ships with ASP.NET Core and is heavily relied on by Swashbuckle. One particular issue here is that SwaggerUI will not treat the parameter as a file and so will not display a file upload button, if you do mistakenly include this attribute.\n\n### Handle File Downloads ###\n`ApiExplorer` (the ASP.NET Core metadata component that Swashbuckle is built on) *DOES NOT* surface the `FileResult` type by default and so you need to explicitly tell it to with the `Produces` attribute:\n```csharp\n[HttpGet(\"{fileName}\")]\n[Produces(\"application/octet-stream\", Type = typeof(FileResult))]\npublic FileResult GetFile(string fileName)\n```\nIf you want the swagger-ui to display a \"Download file\" link, you're operation will need to return a **Content-Type of \"application/octet-stream\"** or a **Content-Disposition of \"attachement\"**.\n\n### Include Descriptions from XML Comments ###\n\nTo enhance the generated docs with human-friendly descriptions, you can annotate controller actions and models with [Xml Comments](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/xmldoc) and configure Swashbuckle to incorporate those comments into the outputted Swagger JSON:\n\n1. Open the Properties dialog for your project, click the \"Build\" tab and ensure that \"XML documentation file\" is checked, or add `<GenerateDocumentationFile>true</GenerateDocumentationFile>` element to the `<PropertyGroup>` section of your .csproj project file. This will produce a file containing all XML comments at build-time.\n\n    _At this point, any classes or methods that are NOT annotated with XML comments will trigger a build warning. To suppress this, enter the warning code \"1591\" into the \"Suppress warnings\" field in the properties dialog or add `<NoWarn>1591</NoWarn>` to the `<PropertyGroup>` section of your .csproj project file._\n\n2. Configure Swashbuckle to incorporate the XML comments on file into the generated Swagger JSON:\n\n    ```csharp\n    services.AddSwaggerGen(c =>\n    {\n        c.SwaggerDoc(\"v1\",\n            new OpenApiInfo\n            {\n                Title = \"My API - V1\",\n                Version = \"v1\"\n            }\n         );\n\n         var filePath = Path.Combine(System.AppContext.BaseDirectory, \"MyApi.xml\");\n         c.IncludeXmlComments(filePath);\n    }\n    ```\n\n3. Annotate your actions with summary, remarks, param and response tags:\n\n    ```csharp\n    /// <summary>\n    /// Retrieves a specific product by unique id\n    /// </summary>\n    /// <remarks>Awesomeness!</remarks>\n    /// <param name=\"id\" example=\"123\">The product id</param>\n    /// <response code=\"200\">Product retrieved</response>\n    /// <response code=\"404\">Product not found</response>\n    /// <response code=\"500\">Oops! Can't lookup your product right now</response>\n    [HttpGet(\"{id}\")]\n    [ProducesResponseType(typeof(Product), 200)]\n    [ProducesResponseType(404)]\n    [ProducesResponseType(500)]\n    public Product GetById(int id)\n    ```\n    \n4. You can also annotate types with summary and example tags:\n\n    ```csharp\n    public class Product\n    {\n        /// <summary>\n        /// The name of the product\n        /// </summary>\n        /// <example>Men's basketball shoes</example>\n        public string Name { get; set; }\n\n        /// <summary>\n        /// Quantity left in stock\n        /// </summary>\n        /// <example>10</example>\n        public int AvailableStock { get; set; }\n\t\n\t/// <summary>\n        /// The sizes the product is available in\n        /// </summary>\n        /// <example>[\"Small\", \"Medium\", \"Large\"]</example>\n\tpublic List<string> Sizes { get; set; }\n    }\n    ```\n\n5. Rebuild your project to update the XML Comments file and navigate to the Swagger JSON endpoint. Note how the descriptions are mapped onto corresponding Swagger fields.\n\n_NOTE: You can also provide Swagger Schema descriptions by annotating your API models and their properties with summary tags. If you have multiple XML comments files (e.g. separate libraries for controllers and models), you can invoke the IncludeXmlComments method multiple times and they will all be merged into the outputted Swagger JSON._\n\n### Provide Global API Metadata ###\n\nIn addition to \"PathItems\", \"Operations\" and \"Responses\", which Swashbuckle generates for you, Swagger also supports global metadata (see https://swagger.io/specification/#oasObject). For example, you can provide a full description for your API, terms of service or even contact and licensing information:\n\n```csharp\nc.SwaggerDoc(\"v1\",\n    new OpenApiInfo\n    {\n        Title = \"My API - V1\",\n        Version = \"v1\",\n        Description = \"A sample API to demo Swashbuckle\",\n        TermsOfService = new Uri(\"http://tempuri.org/terms\"),\n        Contact = new OpenApiContact\n        {\n            Name = \"Joe Developer\",\n            Email = \"joe.developer@tempuri.org\"\n        },\n        License = new OpenApiLicense\n        {\n            Name = \"Apache 2.0\",\n            Url = new Uri(\"http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html\")\n        }\n    }\n);\n```\n\n_TIP: Use IntelliSense to see what other fields are available._\n\n### Generate Multiple Swagger Documents ###\n\nWith the setup described above, the generator will include all API operations in a single Swagger document. However, you can create multiple documents if necessary. For example, you may want a separate document for each version of your API. To do this, start by defining multiple Swagger docs in `Startup.cs`:\n\n```csharp\nservices.AddSwaggerGen(c =>\n{\n    c.SwaggerDoc(\"v1\", new OpenApiInfo { Title = \"My API - V1\", Version = \"v1\" });\n    c.SwaggerDoc(\"v2\", new OpenApiInfo { Title = \"My API - V2\", Version = \"v2\" });\n})\n```\n\n_Take note of the first argument to SwaggerDoc. It MUST be a URI-friendly name that uniquely identifies the document. It's subsequently used to make up the path for requesting the corresponding Swagger JSON. For example, with the default routing, the above documents will be available at \"/swagger/v1/swagger.json\" and \"/swagger/v2/swagger.json\"._\n\nNext, you'll need to inform Swashbuckle which actions to include in each document. Although this can be customized (see below), by default, the generator will use the `ApiDescription.GroupName` property, part of the built-in metadata layer that ships with ASP.NET Core, to make this distinction. You can set this by decorating individual actions OR by applying an application wide convention.\n\n#### Decorate Individual Actions ####\n\nTo include an action in a specific Swagger document, decorate it with the `ApiExplorerSettingsAttribute` and set `GroupName` to the corresponding document name (case sensitive):\n\n```csharp\n[HttpPost]\n[ApiExplorerSettings(GroupName = \"v2\")]\npublic void Post([FromBody]Product product)\n```\n\n#### Assign Actions to Documents by Convention ####\n\nTo group by convention instead of decorating every action, you can apply a custom controller or action convention. For example, you could wire up the following convention to assign actions to documents based on the controller namespace.\n\n```csharp\n// ApiExplorerGroupPerVersionConvention.cs\npublic class ApiExplorerGroupPerVersionConvention : IControllerModelConvention\n{\n    public void Apply(ControllerModel controller)\n    {\n        var controllerNamespace = controller.ControllerType.Namespace; // e.g. \"Controllers.V1\"\n        var apiVersion = controllerNamespace.Split('.').Last().ToLower();\n\n        controller.ApiExplorer.GroupName = apiVersion;\n    }\n}\n\n// Startup.cs\npublic void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)\n{\n    services.AddMvc(c =>\n        c.Conventions.Add(new ApiExplorerGroupPerVersionConvention())\n    );\n\n    ...\n}\n```\n\n#### Customize the Action Selection Process ####\n\nWhen selecting actions for a given Swagger document, the generator invokes a `DocInclusionPredicate` against every `ApiDescription` that's surfaced by the framework. The default implementation inspects `ApiDescription.GroupName` and returns true if the value is either null OR equal to the requested document name. However, you can also provide a custom inclusion predicate. For example, if you're using an attribute-based approach to implement API versioning (e.g. Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Versioning), you could configure a custom predicate that leverages the versioning attributes instead:\n\n```csharp\nc.DocInclusionPredicate((docName, apiDesc) =>\n{\n    if (!apiDesc.TryGetMethodInfo(out MethodInfo methodInfo)) return false;\n\n    var versions = methodInfo.DeclaringType\n        .GetCustomAttributes(true)\n        .OfType<ApiVersionAttribute>()\n        .SelectMany(attr => attr.Versions);\n\n    return versions.Any(v => $\"v{v.ToString()}\" == docName);\n});\n```\n\n#### Exposing Multiple Documents through the UI ####\n\nIf you're using the `SwaggerUI` middleware, you'll need to specify any additional Swagger endpoints you want to expose. See [List Multiple Swagger Documents](#list-multiple-swagger-documents) for more.\n\n### Omit Obsolete Operations and/or Schema Properties ###\n\nThe [Swagger spec](http://swagger.io/specification/) includes a `deprecated` flag for indicating that an operation is deprecated and should be refrained from use. The Swagger generator will automatically set this flag if the corresponding action is decorated with the `ObsoleteAttribute`. However, instead of setting a flag, you can configure the generator to ignore obsolete actions altogether:\n\n```csharp\nservices.AddSwaggerGen(c =>\n{\n    ...\n    c.IgnoreObsoleteActions();\n};\n```\n\nA similar approach can also be used to omit obsolete properties from Schemas in the Swagger output. That is, you can decorate model properties with the `ObsoleteAttribute` and configure Swashbuckle to omit those properties when generating JSON Schemas:\n\n```csharp\nservices.AddSwaggerGen(c =>\n{\n    ...\n    c.IgnoreObsoleteProperties();\n};\n```\n\n### Omit Arbitrary Operations ###\n\nYou can omit operations from the Swagger output by decorating individual actions OR by applying an application wide convention.\n\n#### Decorate Individual Actions ####\n\nTo omit a specific action, decorate it with the `ApiExplorerSettingsAttribute` and set the `IgnoreApi` flag:\n\n```csharp\n[HttpGet(\"{id}\")]\n[ApiExplorerSettings(IgnoreApi = true)]\npublic Product GetById(int id)\n```\n\n#### Omit Actions by Convention ####\n\nTo omit actions by convention instead of decorating them individually, you can apply a custom action convention. For example, you could wire up the following convention to only document GET operations:\n\n```csharp\n// ApiExplorerGetsOnlyConvention.cs\npublic class ApiExplorerGetsOnlyConvention : IActionModelConvention\n{\n    public void Apply(ActionModel action)\n    {\n        action.ApiExplorer.IsVisible = action.Attributes.OfType<HttpGetAttribute>().Any();\n    }\n}\n\n// Startup.cs\npublic void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)\n{\n    services.AddMvc(c =>\n        c.Conventions.Add(new ApiExplorerGetsOnlyConvention())\n    );\n\n    ...\n}\n```\n\n### Customize Operation Tags (e.g. for UI Grouping) ###\n\nThe [Swagger spec](http://swagger.io/specification/) allows one or more \"tags\" to be assigned to an operation. The Swagger generator will assign the controller name as the default tag. This is important to note if you're using the `SwaggerUI` middleware as it uses this value to group operations.\n\nYou can override the default tag by providing a function that applies tags by convention. For example, the following configuration will tag, and therefore group operations in the UI, by HTTP method:\n\n```csharp\nservices.AddSwaggerGen(c =>\n{\n    ...\n    c.TagActionsBy(api => api.HttpMethod);\n};\n```\n\n### Change Operation Sort Order (e.g. for UI Sorting) ###\n\nBy default, actions are ordered by assigned tag (see above) before they're grouped into the path-centric, nested structure of the [Swagger spec](http://swagger.io/specification). But, you can change the default ordering of actions with a custom sorting strategy:\n\n```csharp\nservices.AddSwaggerGen(c =>\n{\n    ...\n    c.OrderActionsBy((apiDesc) => $\"{apiDesc.ActionDescriptor.RouteValues[\"controller\"]}_{apiDesc.HttpMethod}\");\n};\n```\n\n_NOTE: This dictates the sort order BEFORE actions are grouped and transformed into the Swagger format. So, it affects the ordering of groups (i.e. Swagger \"PathItems\"), AND the ordering of operations within a group, in the Swagger output._\n\n### Customize Schema Id's ###\n\nIf the generator encounters complex parameter or response types, it will generate a corresponding JSON Schema, add it to the global `components/schemas` dictionary, and reference it from the operation description by unique Id. For example, if you have an action that returns a `Product` type, then the generated schema will be referenced as follows:\n\n```\nresponses: {\n  200: {\n    description: \"Success\",\n    content: {\n      \"application/json\": {\n        schema: {\n          $ref: \"#/components/schemas/Product\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nHowever, if it encounters multiple types with the same name but different namespaces (e.g. `RequestModels.Product` & `ResponseModels.Product`), then Swashbuckle will raise an exception due to \"Conflicting schemaIds\". In this case, you'll need to provide a custom Id strategy that further qualifies the name:\n\n```csharp\nservices.AddSwaggerGen(c =>\n{\n    ...\n    c.CustomSchemaIds((type) => type.FullName);\n};\n```\n\n### Override Schema for Specific Types ###\n\nOut-of-the-box, Swashbuckle does a decent job at generating JSON Schemas that accurately describe your request and response payloads. However, if you're customizing serialization behavior for certain types in your API, you may need to help it out.\n\nFor example, you might have a class with multiple properties that you want to represent in JSON as a comma-separated string. To do this you would probably implement a custom `JsonConverter`. In this case, Swashbuckle doesn't know how the converter is implemented and so you would need to provide it with a Schema that accurately describes the type:\n\n```csharp\n// PhoneNumber.cs\npublic class PhoneNumber\n{\n    public string CountryCode { get; set; }\n\n    public string AreaCode { get; set; }\n\n    public string SubscriberId { get; set; }\n}\n\n// Startup.cs\nservices.AddSwaggerGen(c =>\n{\n    ...\n    c.MapType<PhoneNumber>(() => new OpenApiSchema { Type = \"string\" });\n};\n```\n\n### Extend Generator with Operation, Schema & Document Filters ###\n\nSwashbuckle exposes a filter pipeline that hooks into the generation process. Once generated, individual metadata objects are passed into the pipeline where they can be modified further. You can wire up custom filters to enrich the generated \"Operations\", \"Schemas\" and \"Documents\".\n\n#### Operation Filters ####\n\nSwashbuckle retrieves an `ApiDescription`, part of ASP.NET Core, for every action and uses it to generate a corresponding `OpenApiOperation`. Once generated, it passes the `OpenApiOperation` and the `ApiDescription` through the list of configured Operation Filters.\n\nIn a typical filter implementation, you would inspect the `ApiDescription` for relevant information (e.g. route info, action attributes etc.) and then update the `OpenApiOperation` accordingly. For example, the following filter lists an additional \"401\" response for all actions that are decorated with the `AuthorizeAttribute`:\n\n```csharp\n// AuthResponsesOperationFilter.cs\npublic class AuthResponsesOperationFilter : IOperationFilter\n{\n    public void Apply(OpenApiOperation operation, OperationFilterContext context)\n    {\n        var authAttributes = context.MethodInfo.DeclaringType.GetCustomAttributes(true)\n            .Union(context.MethodInfo.GetCustomAttributes(true))\n            .OfType<AuthorizeAttribute>();\n\n        if (authAttributes.Any())\n            operation.Responses.Add(\"401\", new OpenApiResponse { Description = \"Unauthorized\" });\n    }\n}\n\n// Startup.cs\nservices.AddSwaggerGen(c =>\n{\n    ...\n    c.OperationFilter<AuthResponsesOperationFilter>();\n};\n```\n\n_NOTE: Filter pipelines are DI-aware. That is, you can create filters with constructor parameters and if the parameter types are registered with the DI framework, they'll be automatically injected when the filters are instantiated_\n\n#### Schema Filters ####\n\nSwashbuckle generates a Swagger-flavored [JSONSchema](http://swagger.io/specification/#schemaObject) for every parameter, response and property type that's exposed by your controller actions. Once generated, it passes the schema and type through the list of configured Schema Filters.\n\nThe example below adds an AutoRest vendor extension (see https://github.com/Azure/autorest/blob/master/docs/extensions/readme.md#x-ms-enum) to inform the AutoRest tool how enums should be modelled when it generates the API client.\n\n```csharp\n// AutoRestSchemaFilter.cs\npublic class AutoRestSchemaFilter : ISchemaFilter\n{\n    public void Apply(OpenApiSchema schema, SchemaFilterContext context)\n    {\n        var type = context.Type;\n        if (type.IsEnum)\n        {\n            schema.Extensions.Add(\n                \"x-ms-enum\",\n                new OpenApiObject\n                {\n                    [\"name\"] = new OpenApiString(type.Name),\n                    [\"modelAsString\"] = new OpenApiBoolean(true)\n                }\n            );\n        };\n    }\n}\n\n// Startup.cs\nservices.AddSwaggerGen(c =>\n{\n    ...\n    c.SchemaFilter<AutoRestSchemaFilter>();\n};\n```\n\nThe example below allows for automatic schema generation of generic `Dictionary<Enum, TValue>` objects.\nNote that this only generates the swagger; `System.Text.Json` is not able to parse dictionary enums by default,\nso you will need [a special JsonConverter, like in the .NET docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/serialization/system-text-json-converters-how-to?pivots=dotnet-5-0#sample-factory-pattern-converter)\n\n```csharp\n// DictionaryTKeyEnumTValueSchemaFilter.cs\npublic class DictionaryTKeyEnumTValueSchemaFilter : ISchemaFilter\n{\n  public void Apply(OpenApiSchema schema, SchemaFilterContext context)\n  {\n    // Only run for fields that are a Dictionary<Enum, TValue>\n    if (!context.Type.IsGenericType || !context.Type.GetGenericTypeDefinition().IsAssignableFrom(typeof(Dictionary<,>)))\n    {\nreturn;\n    }\n\n    var keyType = context.Type.GetGenericArguments()[0];\n    var valueType = context.Type.GetGenericArguments()[1];\n\n    if (!keyType.IsEnum)\n    {\nreturn;\n    }\n\n    schema.Type = \"object\";\n    schema.Properties = keyType.GetEnumNames().ToDictionary(name => name,\nname => context.SchemaGenerator.GenerateSchema(valueType,\n  context.SchemaRepository));\n  }\n}\n\n// Startup.cs\nservices.AddSwaggerGen(c =>\n{\n    ...\n    // These will be replaced by DictionaryTKeyEnumTValueSchemaFilter, but are needed to avoid an error.\n    // You will need one for every kind of Dictionary<,> you have.\n    c.MapType<Dictionary<MyEnum, List<string>>>(() => new OpenApiSchema());\n    c.SchemaFilter<DictionaryTKeyEnumTValueSchemaFilter>();\n};\n\t\n```\n#### Document Filters ####\n\nOnce an `OpenApiDocument` has been generated, it too can be passed through a set of pre-configured Document Filters. This gives full control to modify the document however you see fit. To ensure you're still returning valid Swagger JSON, you should have a read through the [specification](http://swagger.io/specification/) before using this filter type.\n\nThe example below provides a description for any tags that are assigned to operations in the document:\n\n```csharp\npublic class TagDescriptionsDocumentFilter : IDocumentFilter\n{\n    public void Apply(OpenApiDocument swaggerDoc, DocumentFilterContext context)\n    {\n        swaggerDoc.Tags = new List<OpenApiTag> {\n            new OpenApiTag { Name = \"Products\", Description = \"Browse/manage the product catalog\" },\n            new OpenApiTag { Name = \"Orders\", Description = \"Submit orders\" }\n        };\n    }\n}\n```\n\n_NOTE: If you're using the `SwaggerUI` middleware, the `TagDescriptionsDocumentFilter` demonstrated above could be used to display additional descriptions beside each group of Operations._\n\n### Add Security Definitions and Requirements ###\n\nIn Swagger, you can describe how your API is secured by defining one or more security schemes (e.g basic, api key, oauth2 etc.) and declaring which of those schemes are applicable globally OR for specific operations. For more details, take a look at the [Security Requirement Object in the Swagger spec.](https://swagger.io/specification/#securityRequirementObject).\n\nIn Swashbuckle, you can define schemes by invoking the `AddSecurityDefinition` method, providing a name and an instance of `OpenApiSecurityScheme`. For example you can define an [OAuth 2.0 - implicit flow](https://oauth.net/2/) as follows:\n\n```csharp\n// Startup.cs\nservices.AddSwaggerGen(c =>\n{\n    ...\n\n    // Define the OAuth2.0 scheme that's in use (i.e. Implicit Flow)\n    c.AddSecurityDefinition(\"oauth2\", new OpenApiSecurityScheme\n    {\n        Type = SecuritySchemeType.OAuth2,\n        Flows = new OpenApiOAuthFlows\n        {\n            Implicit = new OpenApiOAuthFlow\n            {\n                AuthorizationUrl = new Uri(\"/auth-server/connect/authorize\", UriKind.Relative),\n                Scopes = new Dictionary<string, string>\n                {\n                    { \"readAccess\", \"Access read operations\" },\n                    { \"writeAccess\", \"Access write operations\" }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    });\n};\n```\n\n_NOTE: In addition to defining a scheme, you also need to indicate which operations that scheme is applicable to. You can apply schemes globally (i.e. to ALL operations) through the `AddSecurityRequirement` method. The example below indicates that the scheme called \"oauth2\" should be applied to all operations, and that the \"readAccess\" and \"writeAccess\" scopes are required. When applying schemes of type other than \"oauth2\", the array of scopes MUST be empty._\n\n```csharp\nc.AddSwaggerGen(c =>\n{\n    ...\n\n    c.AddSecurityRequirement(new OpenApiSecurityRequirement\n    {\n        {\n            new OpenApiSecurityScheme\n            {\n                Reference = new OpenApiReference { Type = ReferenceType.SecurityScheme, Id = \"oauth2\" }\n            },\n            new[] { \"readAccess\", \"writeAccess\" }\n        }\n    });\n})\n```\n\nIf you have schemes that are only applicable for certain operations, you can apply them through an Operation filter. For example, the following filter adds OAuth2 requirements based on the presence of the `AuthorizeAttribute`:\n\n```csharp\n// SecurityRequirementsOperationFilter.cs\npublic class SecurityRequirementsOperationFilter : IOperationFilter\n{\n    public void Apply(OpenApiOperation operation, OperationFilterContext context)\n    {\n        // Policy names map to scopes\n        var requiredScopes = context.MethodInfo\n            .GetCustomAttributes(true)\n            .OfType<AuthorizeAttribute>()\n            .Select(attr => attr.Policy)\n            .Distinct();\n\n        if (requiredScopes.Any())\n        {\n            operation.Responses.Add(\"401\", new OpenApiResponse { Description = \"Unauthorized\" });\n            operation.Responses.Add(\"403\", new OpenApiResponse { Description = \"Forbidden\" });\n\n            var oAuthScheme = new OpenApiSecurityScheme\n            {\n                Reference = new OpenApiReference { Type = ReferenceType.SecurityScheme, Id = \"oauth2\" }\n            };\n\n            operation.Security = new List<OpenApiSecurityRequirement>\n            {\n                new OpenApiSecurityRequirement\n                {\n                    [ oAuthScheme ] = requiredScopes.ToList()\n                }\n            };\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n_NOTE: If you're using the `SwaggerUI` middleware, you can enable interactive OAuth2.0 flows that are powered by the emitted security metadata. See [Enabling OAuth2.0 Flows](#enable-oauth20-flows) for more details._\n\n### Add Security Definitions and Requirements for Bearer auth ###\n\n```csharp\nservices.AddSwaggerGen(c =>\n{\n    c.AddSecurityDefinition(\"bearerAuth\", new OpenApiSecurityScheme\n    {\n        Type = SecuritySchemeType.Http,\n        Scheme = \"bearer\",\n        BearerFormat = \"JWT\",\n        Description = \"JWT Authorization header using the Bearer scheme.\"\n    });\n    c.AddSecurityRequirement(new OpenApiSecurityRequirement\n    {\n        {\n            new OpenApiSecurityScheme\n            {\n                Reference = new OpenApiReference { Type = ReferenceType.SecurityScheme, Id = \"bearerAuth\" }\n            },\n            new string[] {}\n        }\n    });\n});\n```\n\n### Inheritance and Polymorphism ###\n\nSwagger / OpenAPI defines the `allOf` and `oneOf` keywords for describing [inheritance and polymorphism](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/data-models/inheritance-and-polymorphism/) relationships in schema definitions. For example, if you're using a base class for models that share common properties you can use the `allOf` keyword to describe the inheritance hierarchy. Or, if your serializer supports polymorphic serialization/deserialization, you can use the `oneOf` keyword to document all the \"possible\" schemas for requests/responses that vary by subtype.\n\n#### Enabling Inheritance ####\n\nBy default, Swashbuckle flattens inheritance hierarchies. That is, for derived models, the inherited properties are combined and listed alongside the declared properties. This can cause a lot of duplication in the generated Swagger, particularly when there's multiple subtypes. It's also problematic if you're using a client generator (e.g. NSwag) and would like to maintain the inheritance hierarchy in the generated client models. To work around this, you can apply the `UseAllOfForInheritance` setting, and this will leverage the `allOf` keyword to incorporate inherited properties by reference in the generated Swagger:\n\n```\nCircle: {\n  type: \"object\",\n  allOf: [\n    {\n      $ref: \"#/components/schemas/Shape\"\n    }\n  ],\n  properties: {\n    radius: {\n      type: \"integer\",\n      format: \"int32\",\n    }\n  },\n},\nShape: {\n  type: \"object\",\n  properties: {\n    name: {\n      type: \"string\",\n      nullable: true,\n    }\n  },\n}\n```\n\n#### Enabling Polymorphism ####\n\nIf your serializer supports polymorphic serialization/deserialization and you would like to list the possible subtypes for an action that accepts/returns abstract base types, you can apply the `UseOneOfForPolymorphism` setting. As a result, the generated request/response schemas will reference a collection of \"possible\" schemas instead of just the base class schema:\n\n```\nrequestBody: {\n  content: {\n    application/json: {\n      schema: {\n      oneOf: [\n        {\n          $ref: \"#/components/schemas/Rectangle\"\n        },\n        {\n          $ref: \"#/components/schemas/Circle\"\n        },\n      ],\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Detecting Subtypes ####\n\nAs inheritance and polymorphism relationships can often become quite complex, not just in your own models but also within the .NET class library, Swashbuckle is selective about which hierarchies it does and doesn't expose in the generated Swagger. By default, it will pick up any subtypes that are defined in the same assembly as a given base type. If you'd like to override this behavior, you can provide a custom selector function:\n\n```csharp\nservices.AddSwaggerGen(c =>\n{\n    ...\n\n    c.UseAllOfForInheritance();\n\n    c.SelectSubTypesUsing(baseType =>\n    {\n        return typeof(Startup).Assembly.GetTypes().Where(type => type.IsSubclassOf(baseType));\n    })\n});\n```\n\n_NOTE: If you're using the [Swashbuckle Annotations library](#swashbuckleaspnetcoreannotations), it contains a custom selector that's based on the presence of `SwaggerSubType` attributes on base class definitions. This way, you can use simple attributes to explicitly list the inheritance and/or polymorphism relationships you want to expose. To enable this behavior, check out the [Annotations docs](#list-known-subtypes-for-inheritance-and-polymorphism)._\n\n#### Describing Discriminators ####\n\nIn conjunction with the `oneOf` and/or `allOf` keywords, Swagger / OpenAPI supports a `discriminator` field on base schema definitions. This keyword points to the property that identifies the specific type being represented by a given payload. In addition to the property name, the discriminator description MAY also include a `mapping` which maps discriminator values to specific schema definitions.\n\nFor example, the Newtonsoft serializer supports polymorphic serialization/deserialization by emitting/accepting a \"$type\" property on JSON instances. The value of this property will be the [assembly qualified type name](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.type.assemblyqualifiedname?view=netcore-3.1) of the type represented by a given JSON instance. So, to explicitly describe this behavior in Swagger, the corresponding request/response schema could be defined as follows:\n\n```\ncomponents: {\n  schemas: {\n    Shape: {\n      required: [\n        \"$type\"\n      ],\n      type: \"object\",\n      properties: {\n        $type: {\n          type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      discriminator: {\n        propertyName: \"$type\",\n        mapping: {\n          Rectangle: \"#/components/schemas/Rectangle\",\n          Circle: \"#/components/schemas/Circle\"\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    Rectangle: {\n      type: \"object\",\n      allOf: [\n        {\n          \"$ref\": \"#/components/schemas/Shape\"\n        }\n      ],\n      ...\n    },\n    Circle: {\n      type: \"object\",\n      allOf: [\n        {\n          \"$ref\": \"#/components/schemas/Shape\"\n        }\n      ],\n      ...\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf `UseAllOfForInheritance` or `UseOneOfForPolymorphism` is enabled, and your serializer supports (and has enabled) emitting/accepting a discriminator property, then Swashbuckle will automatically generate the corresponding `discriminator` metadata on base schema definitions.\n\nAlternatively, if you've customized your serializer to support polymorphic serialization/deserialization, you can provide some custom selector functions to determine the discriminator name and corresponding mapping:\n\n```csharp\nservices.AddSwaggerGen(c =>\n{\n    ...\n\n    c.UseOneOfForInheritance();\n\n    c.SelectDiscriminatorNameUsing((baseType) => \"TypeName\");\n    c.SelectDiscriminatorValueUsing((subType) => subType.Name);\n});\n```\n\n_NOTE: If you're using the [Swashbuckle Annotations library](#swashbuckleaspnetcoreannotations), it contains custom selector functions that are based on the presence of `SwaggerDiscriminator` and `SwaggerSubType` attributes on base class definitions. This way, you can use simple attributes to explicitly provide discriminator metadata. To enable this behavior, check out the [Annotations docs](#enrich-polymorphic-base-classes-with-discriminator-metadata)._\n\n## Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.SwaggerUI ##\n\n### Change Relative Path to the UI ###\n\nBy default, the Swagger UI will be exposed at \"/swagger\". If necessary, you can alter this when enabling the SwaggerUI middleware:\n\n```csharp\napp.UseSwaggerUI(c =>\n{\n    c.RoutePrefix = \"api-docs\"\n    ...\n}\n```\n\n### Change Document Title ###\n\nBy default, the Swagger UI will have a generic document title. When you have multiple Swagger pages open, it can be difficult to tell them apart. You can alter this when enabling the SwaggerUI middleware:\n\n```csharp\napp.UseSwaggerUI(c =>\n{\n    c.DocumentTitle = \"My Swagger UI\";\n    ...\n}\n```\n\n### List Multiple Swagger Documents ###\n\nWhen enabling the middleware, you're required to specify one or more Swagger endpoints (fully qualified or relative to the UI page) to power the UI. If you provide multiple endpoints, they'll be listed in the top right corner of the page, allowing users to toggle between the different documents. For example, the following configuration could be used to document different versions of an API.\n\n```csharp\napp.UseSwaggerUI(c =>\n{\n    c.SwaggerEndpoint(\"/swagger/v1/swagger.json\", \"V1 Docs\");\n    c.SwaggerEndpoint(\"/swagger/v2/swagger.json\", \"V2 Docs\");\n}\n```\n\n### Apply swagger-ui Parameters ###\n\nThe swagger-ui ships with its own set of configuration parameters, all described here https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/blob/v3.8.1/docs/usage/configuration.md#display. In Swashbuckle, most of these are surfaced through the SwaggerUI middleware options:\n\n```csharp\napp.UseSwaggerUI(c =>\n{\n    c.DefaultModelExpandDepth(2);\n    c.DefaultModelRendering(ModelRendering.Model);\n    c.DefaultModelsExpandDepth(-1);\n    c.DisplayOperationId();\n    c.DisplayRequestDuration();\n    c.DocExpansion(DocExpansion.None);\n    c.EnableDeepLinking();\n    c.EnableFilter();\n    c.MaxDisplayedTags(5);\n    c.ShowExtensions();\n    c.ShowCommonExtensions();\n    c.EnableValidator();\n    c.SupportedSubmitMethods(SubmitMethod.Get, SubmitMethod.Head);\n    c.UseRequestInterceptor(\"(request) => { return request; }\");\n    c.UseResponseInterceptor(\"(response) => { return response; }\");\n});\n```\n\n_NOTE: The `InjectOnCompleteJavaScript` and `InjectOnFailureJavaScript` options have been removed because the latest version of swagger-ui doesn't expose the necessary hooks. Instead, it provides a [flexible customization system](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/blob/master/docs/customization/overview.md) based on concepts and patterns from React and Redux. To leverage this, you'll need to provide a custom version of index.html as described [below](#customize-indexhtml)._\n\nThe [custom index sample app](test/WebSites/CustomUIIndex/Swagger/index.html) demonstrates this approach, using the swagger-ui plugin system provide a custom topbar, and to hide the info component.\n\n### Inject Custom CSS ###\n\nTo tweak the look and feel, you can inject additional CSS stylesheets by adding them to your `wwwroot` folder and specifying the relative paths in the middleware options:\n\n```csharp\napp.UseSwaggerUI(c =>\n{\n    ...\n    c.InjectStylesheet(\"/swagger-ui/custom.css\");\n}\n```\n\n### Customize index.html ###\n\nTo customize the UI beyond the basic options listed above, you can provide your own version of the swagger-ui index.html page:\n\n```csharp\napp.UseSwaggerUI(c =>\n{\n    c.IndexStream = () => GetType().Assembly\n        .GetManifestResourceStream(\"CustomUIIndex.Swagger.index.html\"); // requires file to be added as an embedded resource\n});\n```\n\n_To get started, you should base your custom index.html on the [default version](src/Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.SwaggerUI/index.html)_\n\n### Enable OAuth2.0 Flows ###\n\nThe swagger-ui has built-in support to participate in OAuth2.0 authorization flows. It interacts with authorization and/or token endpoints, as specified in the Swagger JSON, to obtain access tokens for subsequent API calls. See [Adding Security Definitions and Requirements](#add-security-definitions-and-requirements) for an example of adding OAuth2.0 metadata to the generated Swagger.\n\nIf your Swagger endpoint includes the appropriate security metadata, the UI interaction should be automatically enabled. However, you can further customize OAuth support in the UI with the following settings below. See https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/blob/v3.10.0/docs/usage/oauth2.md for more info:\n\n```csharp\napp.UseSwaggerUI(c =>\n{\n    ...\n\n    c.OAuthClientId(\"test-id\");\n    c.OAuthClientSecret(\"test-secret\");\n    c.OAuthRealm(\"test-realm\");\n    c.OAuthAppName(\"test-app\");\n    c.OAuthScopeSeparator(\" \");\n    c.OAuthAdditionalQueryStringParams(new Dictionary<string, string> { { \"foo\", \"bar\" }}); \n    c.OAuthUseBasicAuthenticationWithAccessCodeGrant();\n});\n```\n\n### Use client-side request and response interceptors ###\n\nTo use custom interceptors on requests and responses going through swagger-ui you can define them as javascript functions in the configuration:\n\n```csharp\napp.UseSwaggerUI(c =>\n{\n    ...\n\n    c.UseRequestInterceptor(\"(req) => { req.headers['x-my-custom-header'] = 'MyCustomValue'; return req; }\");\n    c.UseResponseInterceptor(\"(res) => { console.log('Custom interceptor intercepted response from:', res.url); return res; }\");\n});\n```\n\nThis can be useful in a range of scenarios where you might want to append local xsrf tokens to all requests for example:\n\n```csharp\napp.UseSwaggerUI(c =>\n{\n    ...\n\n    c.UseRequestInterceptor(\"(req) => { req.headers['X-XSRF-Token'] = localStorage.getItem('xsrf-token'); return req; }\");\n});\n```\n\n## Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.Annotations ##\n\n### Install and Enable Annotations ###\n\n1. Install the following Nuget package into your ASP.NET Core application.\n\n    ```\n    Package Manager : Install-Package Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.Annotations\n    CLI : dotnet add package Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.Annotations\n    ```\n\n2. In the `ConfigureServices` method of `Startup.cs`, enable annotations within in the Swagger config block:\n\n    ```csharp\n    services.AddSwaggerGen(c =>\n    {\n       ...\n\n       c.EnableAnnotations();\n    });\n    ```\n\n### Enrich Operation Metadata ###\n\nOnce annotations have been enabled, you can enrich the generated Operation metadata by decorating actions with a `SwaggerOperationAttribute`.\n\n```csharp\n[HttpPost]\n\n[SwaggerOperation(\n    Summary = \"Creates a new product\",\n    Description = \"Requires admin privileges\",\n    OperationId = \"CreateProduct\",\n    Tags = new[] { \"Purchase\", \"Products\" }\n)]\npublic IActionResult Create([FromBody]Product product)\n```\n\n### Enrich Response Metadata ###\n\nASP.NET Core provides the `ProducesResponseTypeAttribute` for listing the different responses that can be returned by an action. These attributes can be combined with XML comments, as described [above](#include-descriptions-from-xml-comments), to include human friendly descriptions with each response in the generated Swagger. If you'd prefer to do all of this with a single attribute, and avoid the use of XML comments, you can use `SwaggerResponseAttribute`s instead:\n\n```csharp\n[HttpPost]\n[SwaggerResponse(201, \"The product was created\", typeof(Product))]\n[SwaggerResponse(400, \"The product data is invalid\")]\npublic IActionResult Create([FromBody]Product product)\n```\n\n### Enrich Parameter Metadata ###\n\nYou can annotate \"path\", \"query\" or \"header\" bound parameters or properties (i.e. decorated with `[FromRoute]`, `[FromQuery]` or `[FromHeader]`) with a `SwaggerParameterAttribute` to enrich the corresponding `Parameter` metadata that's generated by Swashbuckle:\n\n```csharp\n[HttpGet]\npublic IActionResult GetProducts(\n    [FromQuery, SwaggerParameter(\"Search keywords\", Required = true)]string keywords)\n```\n\n### Enrich RequestBody Metadata ###\n\nYou can annotate \"body\" bound parameters or properties (i.e. decorated with `[FromBody]`) with a `SwaggerRequestBodyAttribute` to enrich the corresponding `RequestBody` metadata that's generated by Swashbuckle:\n\n```csharp\n[HttpPost]\npublic IActionResult CreateProduct(\n    [FromBody, SwaggerRequestBody(\"The product payload\", Required = true)]Product product)\n```\n\n### Enrich Schema Metadata ###\n\nYou can annotate classes or properties with a `SwaggerSchemaAttribute` to enrich the corresponding `Schema` metadata that's generated by Swashbuckle:\n\n```csharp\n[SwaggerSchema(Required = new[] { \"Description\" })]\npublic class Product\n{\n\t[SwaggerSchema(\"The product identifier\", ReadOnly = true)]\n\tpublic int Id { get; set; }\n\n\t[SwaggerSchema(\"The product description\")]\n\tpublic string Description { get; set; }\n\n\t[SwaggerSchema(\"The date it was created\", Format = \"date\")]\n\tpublic DateTime DateCreated { get; set; }\n}\n```\n\n_NOTE: In Swagger / OpenAPI, serialized objects AND contained properties are represented as `Schema` instances, hence why this annotation can be applied to both classes and properties. Also worth noting, \"required\" properties are specified as an array of property names on the top-level schema as opposed to a flag on each individual property._\n\n### Apply Schema Filters to Specific Types ###\n\nThe `SwaggerGen` package provides several extension points, including Schema Filters ([described here](#extend-generator-with-operation-schema--document-filter)) for customizing ALL generated Schemas. However, there may be cases where it's preferable to apply a filter to a specific Schema. For example, if you'd like to include an example for a specific type in your API. This can be done by decorating the type with a `SwaggerSchemaFilterAttribute`:\n\n```csharp\n// Product.cs\n[SwaggerSchemaFilter(typeof(ProductSchemaFilter))]\npublic class Product\n{\n    ...\n}\n\n// ProductSchemaFilter.cs\npublic class ProductSchemaFilter : ISchemaFilter\n{\n    public void Apply(OpenApiSchema schema, SchemaFilterContext context)\n    {\n        schema.Example = new OpenApiObject\n        {\n            [ \"Id\" ] = new OpenApiInteger(1),\n            [ \"Description\" ] = new OpenApiString(\"An awesome product\")\n        };\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Add Tag Metadata\n\nBy default, the Swagger generator will tag all operations with the controller name. This tag is then used to drive the operation groupings in the swagger-ui. If you'd like to provide a description for each of these groups, you can do so by adding metadata for each controller name tag via the `SwaggerTagAttribute`:\n\n```csharp\n[SwaggerTag(\"Create, read, update and delete Products\")]\npublic class ProductsController\n{\n    ...\n}\n```\n\n_NOTE: This will add the above description specifically to the tag named \"Products\". Therefore, you should avoid using this attribute if you're tagging Operations with something other than controller name - e.g. if you're customizing the tagging behavior with `TagActionsBy`._\n\n### List Known Subtypes for Inheritance and Polymorphism ###\n\nIf you want to use Swashbuckle's [inheritance and/or polymorphism behavior](#inheritance-and-polymorphism), you can use annotations to _explicitly_ indicate the \"known\" subtypes for a given base type. This will override the default selector function, which selects _all_ subtypes in the same assembly as the base type, and therefore needs to be explicitly enabled when you enable Annotations:\n\n```csharp\n// Startup.cs\nservices.AddSwaggerGen(c =>\n{\n    c.EnableAnnotations(enableAnnotationsForInheritance: true, enableAnnotationsForPolymorphism: true);\n});\n\n// Shape.cs\n[SwaggerSubType(typeof(Rectangle))]\n[SwaggerSubType(typeof(Circle))]\npublic abstract class Shape\n{\n}\n```\n\n### Enrich Polymorphic Base Classes with Discriminator Metadata ###\n\nIf you're using annotations to _explicitly_ indicate the \"known\" subtypes for a polymorphic base type, you can combine the `SwaggerDiscriminatorAttribute` with the `SwaggerSubTypeAttribute` to provide additional metadata about the \"discriminator\" property, which will then be incorporated into the generated schema definition:\n\n\n```csharp\n// Startup.cs\nservices.AddSwaggerGen(c =>\n{\n    c.EnableAnnotations(enableAnnotationsForInheritance: true, enableAnnotationsForPolymorphism: true);\n});\n\n// Shape.cs\n[SwaggerDiscriminator(\"shapeType\")]\n[SwaggerSubType(typeof(Rectangle), DiscriminatorValue = \"rectangle\")]\n[SwaggerSubType(typeof(Circle), DiscriminatorValue = \"circle\")]\npublic abstract class Shape\n{\n    public ShapeType { get; set; }\n}\n```\n\nThis indicates that the corresponding payload will have a \"shapeType\" property to discriminate between subtypes, and that property will have a value of \"rectangle\" if the payload represents a `Rectangle` type and a value of \"circle\" if it represents a `Circle` type. This detail will be described in the generated schema definition as follows:\n\n```\nschema: {\n  oneOf: [\n    {\n      $ref: \"#/components/schemas/Rectangle\"\n    },\n    {\n      $ref: \"#/components/schemas/Circle\"\n    },\n  ],\n  discriminator: {\n    propertyName: shapeType,\n    mapping: {\n      rectangle: \"#/components/schemas/Rectangle\",\n      circle: \"#/components/schemas/Circle\",\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.Cli ##\n\n### Retrieve Swagger Directly from a Startup Assembly ###\n\nOnce your application has been setup with Swashbuckle (see [Getting Started](#getting-started)), you can use the Swashbuckle CLI tool to retrieve Swagger / OpenAPI JSON directly from your application's startup assembly, and write it to file. This can be useful if you want to incorporate Swagger generation into a CI/CD process, or if you want to serve it from static file at run-time.\n\nIt's packaged as a [.NET Core Tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/global-tools) that can be installed and used via the dotnet SDK.\n\n> :warning: The tool needs to load your Startup DLL and its dependencies at runtime. Therefore, you should use a version of the `dotnet` SDK that is compatible with your application. For example, if your app targets `netcoreapp2.1`, then you should use version 2.1 of the SDK to run the CLI tool. If it targets `netcoreapp3.0`, then you should use version 3.0 of the SDK and so on.\n\n#### Using the tool with the .NET Core 2.1 SDK\n\n1. Install as a [global tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/global-tools#install-a-global-tool)\n\n    ```\n    dotnet tool install -g --version 6.5.0 Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.Cli\n    ```\n\n2. Verify that the tool was installed correctly\n\n    ```\n    swagger tofile --help\n    ```\n\n3. Generate a Swagger/ OpenAPI document from your application's startup assembly\n\n\t```\n\tswagger tofile --output [output] [startupassembly] [swaggerdoc]\n\t```\n\n\tWhere ...\n\t* [output] is the relative path where the Swagger JSON will be output to\n\t* [startupassembly] is the relative path to your application's startup assembly\n\t* [swaggerdoc] is the name of the swagger document you want to retrieve, as configured in your startup class\n\n#### Using the tool with the .NET Core 3.0 SDK or later\n\n1. In your project root, create a tool manifest file:\n\n    ```\n    dotnet new tool-manifest\n    ```\n\n2. Install as a [local tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/global-tools#install-a-local-tool)\n\n    ```\n    dotnet tool install --version 6.5.0 Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.Cli\n    ```\n\n3. Verify that the tool was installed correctly\n\n    ```\n    dotnet swagger tofile --help\n    ```\n\n4. Generate a Swagger / OpenAPI document from your application's startup assembly\n\n\t```\n\tdotnet swagger tofile --output [output] [startupassembly] [swaggerdoc]\n\t```\n\n\tWhere ...\n\t* [output] is the relative path where the Swagger JSON will be output to\n\t* [startupassembly] is the relative path to your application's startup assembly\n\t* [swaggerdoc] is the name of the swagger document you want to retrieve, as configured in your startup class\n\n### Use the CLI Tool with a Custom Host Configuration\n\nOut-of-the-box, the tool will execute in the context of a \"default\" web host. However, in some cases you may want to bring your own host environment, for example if you've configured a custom DI container such as Autofac. For this scenario, the Swashbuckle CLI tool exposes a convention-based hook for your application.\n\nThat is, if your application contains a class that meets either of the following naming conventions, then that class will be used to provide a host for the CLI tool to run in.\n\n- `public class SwaggerHostFactory`, containing a public static method called `CreateHost` with return type `IHost`\n- `public class SwaggerWebHostFactory`, containing a public static method called `CreateWebHost` with return type `IWebHost`\n\nFor example, the following class could be used to leverage the same host configuration as your application:\n\n```csharp\npublic class SwaggerHostFactory\n{\n    public static IHost CreateHost()\n    {\n        return Program.CreateHostBuilder(new string[0]).Build();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.ReDoc ##\n\n<h3 id=\"redoc-change-relative-path-to-the-ui\">Change Relative Path to the UI</h3>\n\nBy default, the ReDoc UI will be exposed at \"/api-docs\". If necessary, you can alter this when enabling the ReDoc middleware:\n\n```csharp\napp.UseReDoc(c =>\n{\n    c.RoutePrefix = \"docs\"\n    ...\n}\n```\n\n<h3 id=\"redoc-change-document-title\">Change Document Title</h3>\n\nBy default, the ReDoc UI will have a generic document title. You can alter this when enabling the ReDoc middleware:\n\n```csharp\napp.UseReDoc(c =>\n{\n    c.DocumentTitle = \"My API Docs\";\n    ...\n}\n```\n\n### Apply ReDoc Parameters ###\n\nReDoc ships with its own set of configuration parameters, all described here https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc/blob/master/README.md#redoc-options-object. In Swashbuckle, most of these are surfaced through the ReDoc middleware options:\n\n```csharp\napp.UseReDoc(c =>\n{\n    c.SpecUrl(\"/v1/swagger.json\");\n    c.EnableUntrustedSpec();\n    c.ScrollYOffset(10);\n    c.HideHostname();\n    c.HideDownloadButton();\n    c.ExpandResponses(\"200,201\");\n    c.RequiredPropsFirst();\n    c.NoAutoAuth();\n    c.PathInMiddlePanel();\n    c.HideLoading();\n    c.NativeScrollbars();\n    c.DisableSearch();\n    c.OnlyRequiredInSamples();\n    c.SortPropsAlphabetically();\n});\n```\n\n_Using `c.SpecUrl(\"/v1/swagger.json\")` multiple times within the same `UseReDoc(...)` will not add multiple urls._\n\n<h3 id=\"redoc-inject-custom-css\">Inject Custom CSS</h3>\n\nTo tweak the look and feel, you can inject additional CSS stylesheets by adding them to your `wwwroot` folder and specifying the relative paths in the middleware options:\n\n```csharp\napp.UseReDoc(c =>\n{\n    ...\n    c.InjectStylesheet(\"/redoc/custom.css\");\n}\n```\n\nIt is also possible to modify the theme by using the `AdditionalItems` property, see https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc/blob/master/README.md#redoc-options-object for more information.\n\n```csharp\napp.UseReDoc(c =>\n{\n    ...\n    c.ConfigObject.AdditionalItems = ...\n}\n```\n\n<h3 id=\"redoc-customize-indexhtml\">Customize index.html</h3>\n\nTo customize the UI beyond the basic options listed above, you can provide your own version of the ReDoc index.html page:\n\n```csharp\napp.UseReDoc(c =>\n{\n    c.IndexStream = () => GetType().Assembly\n        .GetManifestResourceStream(\"CustomIndex.ReDoc.index.html\"); // requires file to be added as an embedded resource\n});\n```\n\n_To get started, you should base your custom index.html on the [default version](src/Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.ReDoc/index.html)_\n"

  Prance provides parsers for `Swagger/OpenAPI

  2.0 and 3.0 <http://swagger.io/specification/>`__ API specifications in
  Python.

  It uses `openapi\_spec\_validator
  <https://github.com/p1c2u/openapi-spec-validator>`__,

  `swagger\_spec\_validator <https://github.com/Yelp/swagger_spec_validator>`__
  or

  `flex <https://github.com/pipermerriam/flex>`__

  to validate specifications, but additionally resolves `JSON

  references <https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-pbryan-zyp-json-ref-03>`__

  in accordance with the OpenAPI spec.


  Mostly the latter involves handling non-URI references; OpenAPI is fine

  with providing relative file paths, whereas JSON references require URIs

  at this point in time.


  Prance is `up for adoption
  <https://github.com/jfinkhaeuser/prance/issues/91>`__.


  Usage

  =====


  Installation

  ------------


  Prance is available from PyPI, and can be installed via pip:


  .. code:: bash

      $ pip install prance

  Note that this will install the code, but additional subpackages must be
  specified

  to unlock various pieces of functionality. At minimum, a parsing backend must
  be

  installed. For the CLI functionality, you need further dependencies.


  The recommended installation installs the CLI, uses ICU and installs one
  validation

  backend:


  .. code:: bash

      $ pip install prance[osv,icu,cli]

  Make sure you have `ICU Unicode Library <http://site.icu-project.org/home>`__
  installed,

  as well as Python dev library before running the commands above. If not, use
  the

  following commands:


  **Ubuntu**


  .. code:: bash

      $ sudo apt-get install libicu-dev
      $ sudo apt-get install python3-dev


  Command Line Interface

  ----------------------


  After installing prance, a CLI is available for validating (and resolving

  external references in) specs:


  .. code:: bash

      # Validates with resolving
      $ prance validate path/to/swagger.yml

      # Validates without resolving
      $ prance validate --no-resolve path/to/swagger.yml

      # Fetch URL, validate and resolve.
      $ prance validate http://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json
      Processing "http://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json"...
       -> Resolving external references.
      Validates OK as Swagger/OpenAPI 2.0!

  Validation is not the only feature of prance. One of the side effects of

  resolving is that from a spec with references, one can create a fully resolved

  output spec. In the past, this was done via options to the ``validate``
  command,

  but now there's a specific command just for this purpose:


  .. code:: bash

      # Compile spec
      $ prance compile path/to/input.yml path/to/output.yml


  Lastly, with the arrival of OpenAPI 3.0.0, it becomes useful for tooling to

  convert older specs to the new standard. Instead of re-inventing the wheel,

  prance just provides a CLI command for passing specs to the web API of

  `swagger2openapi <https://github.com/Mermade/swagger2openapi>`__ - a working

  internet connection is therefore required for this command:


  .. code:: bash

      # Convert spec
      $ prance convert path/to/swagger.yml path/to/openapi.yml


  Code

  ----


  Most likely you have spec file and want to parse it:


  .. code:: python

      from prance import ResolvingParser
      parser = ResolvingParser('path/to/my/swagger.yaml')
      parser.specification  # contains fully resolved specs as a dict

  Prance also includes a non-resolving parser that does not follow JSON

  references, in case you prefer that.


  .. code:: python

      from prance import BaseParser
      parser = BaseParser('path/to/my/swagger.yaml')
      parser.specification  # contains specs as a dict still containing JSON references

  On Windows, the code reacts correctly if you pass posix-like paths

  (``/c:/swagger``) or if the path is relative.  If you pass absolute

  windows path (like ``c:\swagger.yaml``), you can use

  ``prance.util.fs.abspath`` to convert them.


  URLs can also be parsed:


  .. code:: python

      parser = ResolvingParser('http://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json')

  Largely, that's it. There is a whole slew of utility code that you may

  or may not find useful, too. Look at the `full documentation

  <https://jfinkhaeuser.github.io/prance/#api-modules>`__ for details.



  Compatibility

  -------------


  *Python Versions*


  Version 0.16.2 is the last version supporting Python 2. It was released on

  Nov 12th, 2019. Python 2 reaches end of life at the end of 2019. If you wish

  for updates to the Python 2 supported packages, please contact the maintainer

  directly.


  Until fairly recently, we also tested with `PyPy <https://www.pypy.org/>`__.

  Unfortunately, Travis isn't very good at supporting this. So in the absence

  of spare time, they're disabled. `Issue 50
  <https://github.com/jfinkhaeuser/prance/issues/50>`__

  tracks progress on that.


  Similarly, but less critically, Python 3.4 is no longer receiving a lot of

  love from CI vendors, so automated builds on that version are no longer

  supported.


  *Backends*


  Different validation backends support different features.


  +------------------------+----------------+-----------------+-------------+-------------------------------------------------------+----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

  `openapi\_spec\_validator
  <https://github.com/p1c2u/openapi-spec-validator>`__    |

  +------------------------+----------------+-----------------+-------------+-------------------------------------------------------+----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+


  You can select the backend in the constructor of the parser(s):


  .. code:: python

      parser = ResolvingParser('http://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json', backend = 'openapi-spec-validator')


  No backend is included in the dependencies; they are detected at run-time. If
  you install them,

  they can be used:


  .. code:: bash

      $ pip install openapi-spec-validator
      $ pip install prance
      $ prance validate --backend=openapi-spec-validator path/to/spec.yml

  *A note on flex usage:* While flex is the fastest validation backend,
  unfortunately it is no longer

  maintained and there are issues with its dependencies. For one thing, it
  depends on a version of `PyYAML`

  that contains security flaws. For another, it depends explicitly on older
  versions of `click`.


  If you use the flex subpackage, therefore, you do so at your own risk.


  *Compatibility*


  See `COMPATIBILITY.rst
  <https://github.com/jfinkhaeuser/prance/blob/master/COMPATIBILITY.rst>`__

  for a list of known issues.



  Partial Reference Resolution

  ----------------------------


  It's possible to instruct the parser to only resolve some kinds of references.

  This allows e.g. resolving references from external URLs, whilst keeping local

  references (i.e. to local files, or file internal) intact.


  .. code:: python

      from prance import ResolvingParser
      from prance.util.resolver import RESOLVE_HTTP

      parser = ResolvingParser('/path/to/spec', resolve_types = RESOLVE_HTTP)


  Multiple types can be specified by OR-ing constants together:


  .. code:: python

      from prance import ResolvingParser
      from prance.util.resolver import RESOLVE_HTTP, RESOLVE_FILES

      parser = ResolvingParser('/path/to/spec', resolve_types = RESOLVE_HTTP | RESOLVE_FILES)


  Extensions

  ----------


  Prance includes the ability to reference outside swagger definitions

  in outside Python packages. Such a package must already be importable

  (i.e. installed), and be accessible via the

  `ResourceManager API
  <https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pkg_resources.html#resourcemanager-api>`__

  (some more info `here
  <https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#including-data-files>`__).


  For example, you might create a package ``common_swag`` with the file

  ``base.yaml`` containing the definition


  .. code:: yaml

      definitions:
        Severity:
          type: string
          enum:
          - INFO
          - WARN
          - ERROR
          - FATAL

  In the ``setup.py`` for ``common_swag`` you would add lines such as


  .. code:: python

      packages=find_packages('src'),
      package_dir={'': 'src'},
      package_data={
          '': '*.yaml'
      }

  Then, having installed ``common_swag`` into some application, you could

  now write


  .. code:: yaml

      definitions:
        Message:
          type: object
          properties:
            severity:
              $ref: 'python://common_swag/base.yaml#/definitions/Severity'
            code:
              type: string
            summary:
              type: string
            description:
              type: string
          required:
          - severity
          - summary

  Generate Swagger documentation from pedestal (or tripod) routes


  - [Demo](https://pedestal-swagger.herokuapp.com)


  ## For old pedestal-swagger users


  This project now focuses solely on route transformation and schema validation
  and thus is pedestal-agnostic.


  Route-swagger is a much lower level library. Everything the old
  pedestal-swagger did is still possible (look at the example repo) but requires
  a bit more boilerplate. The major breaking difference is that now
  route-swagger uses ring specific keys for describing the schema rather than
  swagger ones, e.g.


  ```clj

  {:parameters {:body-params ..
                :form-params ..
                :query-params ..
                :path-params ..
                :headers ..}
    :responses {500 {:body .. :headers ..}}}            
  ```


  Instead of `body`, `formData`, `query`, `schema`, etc. That should make it
  much more user friendly for clojure users.


  For a nicer integration with pedestal, extra features and easier migration
  path from the old pedestal-swagger check out
  [pedestal-api](https://github.com/oliyh/pedestal-api).

  The grpc-gateway is a plugin of the Google protocol buffers compiler

  [protoc](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf).

  It reads protobuf service definitions and generates a reverse-proxy server
  which

  'translates a RESTful HTTP API into gRPC. This server is generated according
  to the

  [`google.api.http`](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/api/http.proto#L46)

  annotations in your service definitions.


  This helps you provide your APIs in both gRPC and RESTful style at the same
  time.


  ![architecture introduction
  diagram](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/12hp4CPqrNPFhattL_cIoJptFvlAqm5wLQ0ggqI5mkCg/pub?w=749&amp;h=370)


  ## Check out our
  [documentation](https://grpc-ecosystem.github.io/grpc-gateway/)!


  ## Background

  gRPC is great -- it generates API clients and server stubs in many programming

  languages, it is fast, easy-to-use, bandwidth-efficient and its design is

  combat-proven by Google. However, you might still want to provide a
  traditional

  RESTful JSON API as well. Reasons can range from maintaining

  backwards-compatibility, supporting languages or clients not well supported by

  gRPC, to simply maintaining the aesthetics and tooling involved with a RESTful

  JSON architecture.


  This project aims to provide that HTTP+JSON interface to your gRPC service.

  A small amount of configuration in your service to attach HTTP semantics is
  all

  that's needed to generate a reverse-proxy with this library.


  ## Installation


  The grpc-gateway requires a local installation of the Google protocol buffers

  compiler `protoc` v3.0.0 or above. Please install this via your local package

  manager or by downloading one of the releases from the official repository:


  https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases


  The following instructions assume you are using

  [Go Modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) for dependency

  management. Use a

  [tool
  dependency](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules#how-can-i-track-tool-dependencies-for-a-module)

  to track the versions of the following executable packages:


  ```go

  // +build tools


  package tools


  import (
      _ "github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/protoc-gen-grpc-gateway"
      _ "github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/protoc-gen-swagger"
      _ "github.com/golang/protobuf/protoc-gen-go"
  )

  ```


  Run `go mod tidy` to resolve the versions. Install by running


  ```sh

  $ go install \
      github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/protoc-gen-grpc-gateway \
      github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/protoc-gen-swagger \
      github.com/golang/protobuf/protoc-gen-go
  ```


  This will place three binaries in your `$GOBIN`;


  * `protoc-gen-grpc-gateway`

  * `protoc-gen-swagger`

  * `protoc-gen-go`


  Make sure that your `$GOBIN` is in your `$PATH`.


  ## Usage


  1. Define your [gRPC](https://grpc.io/docs/) service using protocol buffers 

     `your_service.proto`:
     ```protobuf
     syntax = "proto3";
     package example;
     message StringMessage {
       string value = 1;
     }

     service YourService {
       rpc Echo(StringMessage) returns (StringMessage) {}
     }
     ```

  2. Add a
  [`google.api.http`](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/api/http.proto#L46)

  annotation to your .proto file

     `your_service.proto`:
     ```diff
      syntax = "proto3";
      package example;
     +
     +import "google/api/annotations.proto";
     +
      message StringMessage {
        string value = 1;
      }

      service YourService {
     -  rpc Echo(StringMessage) returns (StringMessage) {}
     +  rpc Echo(StringMessage) returns (StringMessage) {
     +    option (google.api.http) = {
     +      post: "/v1/example/echo"
     +      body: "*"
     +    };
     +  }
      }
     ```

     See [a_bit_of_everything.proto](examples/internal/proto/examplepb/a_bit_of_everything.proto)
     for examples of more annotations you can add to customize gateway behavior
     and generated Swagger output.

     If you do not want to modify the proto file for use with grpc-gateway you can
     alternatively use an external
     [gRPC Service Configuration](https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/docs/grpc/grpc-service-config) file.
     [Check our documentation](https://grpc-ecosystem.github.io/grpc-gateway/docs/grpcapiconfiguration.html)
     for more information.

  3. Generate gRPC stub

     The following generates gRPC code for Golang based on `path/to/your_service.proto`:
     ```sh
     protoc -I/usr/local/include -I. \
       -I$GOPATH/src \
       -I$GOPATH/src/github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/third_party/googleapis \
       --go_out=plugins=grpc:. \
       path/to/your_service.proto
     ```

     It will generate a stub file `path/to/your_service.pb.go`.

  4. Implement your service in gRPC as usual

     1. (Optional) Generate gRPC stub in the [other programming languages](https://grpc.io/docs/).

       For example, the following generates gRPC code for Ruby based on `path/to/your_service.proto`:
       ```sh
       protoc -I/usr/local/include -I. \
         -I$GOPATH/src \
         -I$GOPATH/src/github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/third_party/googleapis \
         --ruby_out=. \
         path/to/your_service.proto

       protoc -I/usr/local/include -I. \
         -I$GOPATH/src \
         -I$GOPATH/src/github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/third_party/googleapis \
         --plugin=protoc-gen-grpc=grpc_ruby_plugin \
         --grpc-ruby_out=. \
         path/to/your_service.proto
       ```
     2. Add the googleapis-common-protos gem (or your language equivalent) as a dependency to your project.
     3. Implement your gRPC service stubs

  5. Generate reverse-proxy using `protoc-gen-grpc-gateway`

     ```sh
     protoc -I/usr/local/include -I. \
       -I$GOPATH/src \
       -I$GOPATH/src/github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/third_party/googleapis \
       --grpc-gateway_out=logtostderr=true:. \
       path/to/your_service.proto
     ```

     It will generate a reverse proxy `path/to/your_service.pb.gw.go`.

  6. Write an entrypoint for the HTTP reverse-proxy server

     ```go
     package main
   
     import (
       "context"  // Use "golang.org/x/net/context" for Golang version <= 1.6
       "flag"
       "net/http"
   
       "github.com/golang/glog"
       "github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/runtime"
       "google.golang.org/grpc"
   
       gw "path/to/your_service_package"  // Update
     )
   
     var (
       // command-line options:
       // gRPC server endpoint
       grpcServerEndpoint = flag.String("grpc-server-endpoint",  "localhost:9090", "gRPC server endpoint")
     )
   
     func run() error {
       ctx := context.Background()
       ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(ctx)
       defer cancel()
   
       // Register gRPC server endpoint
       // Note: Make sure the gRPC server is running properly and accessible
       mux := runtime.NewServeMux()
       opts := []grpc.DialOption{grpc.WithInsecure()}
       err := gw.RegisterYourServiceHandlerFromEndpoint(ctx, mux,  *grpcServerEndpoint, opts)
       if err != nil {
         return err
       }
   
       // Start HTTP server (and proxy calls to gRPC server endpoint)
       return http.ListenAndServe(":8081", mux)
     }
   
     func main() {
       flag.Parse()
       defer glog.Flush()
   
       if err := run(); err != nil {
         glog.Fatal(err)
       }
     }
     ```

  7. (Optional) Generate swagger definitions using `protoc-gen-swagger`

     ```sh
     protoc -I/usr/local/include -I. \
       -I$GOPATH/src \
       -I$GOPATH/src/github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/third_party/googleapis \
       --swagger_out=logtostderr=true:. \
       path/to/your_service.proto
     ```

  ## Video intro


  This GopherCon UK 2019 presentation from our maintainer

  [@JohanBrandhorst](https://github.com/johanbrandhorst) provides a good intro
  to

  using the grpc-gateway. It uses the following boilerplate repo as a base:

  https://github.com/johanbrandhorst/grpc-gateway-boilerplate.


  [![gRPC-Gateway
  presentation](https://img.youtube.com/vi/Pq1paKC-fXk/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pq1paKC-fXk)


  ## Parameters and flags


  During code generation with `protoc`, flags to grpc-gateway tools must be
  passed

  through protoc using the `--<tool_suffix>_out=<flags>:<path>` pattern, for

  example:


  ```sh

  --grpc-gateway_out=logtostderr=true,repeated_path_param_separator=ssv:.

  --swagger_out=logtostderr=true,repeated_path_param_separator=ssv:.

  ```


  `protoc-gen-grpc-gateway` supports custom mapping from Protobuf `import` to

  Golang import paths. They are compatible to

  [the parameters with same names in
  `protoc-gen-go`](https://github.com/golang/protobuf#parameters)

  (except `source_relative`).


  In addition we also support the `request_context` parameter in order to use
  the

  `http.Request`'s Context (only for Go 1.7 and above). This parameter can be

  useful to pass request scoped context between the gateway and the gRPC
  service.


  `protoc-gen-grpc-gateway` also supports some more command line flags to
  control

  logging. You can give these flags together with parameters above. Run

  `protoc-gen-grpc-gateway --help` for more details about the flags.


  Similarly, `protoc-gen-swagger` supports command-line flags to control Swagger

  output (for example, `json_names_for_fields` to output JSON names for fields

  instead of protobuf names). Run `protoc-gen-swagger --help` for more flag

  details. Further Swagger customization is possible by annotating your `.proto`

  files with options from

  [openapiv2.proto](protoc-gen-swagger/options/openapiv2.proto) - see

  [a_bit_of_everything.proto](examples/internal/proto/examplepb/a_bit_of_everything.proto)

  for examples.


  ## More Examples

  More examples are available under `examples` directory.

  * `proto/examplepb/echo_service.proto`,
  `proto/examplepb/a_bit_of_everything.proto`,
  `proto/examplepb/unannotated_echo_service.proto`: service definition
    * `proto/examplepb/echo_service.pb.go`, `proto/examplepb/a_bit_of_everything.pb.go`, `proto/examplepb/unannotated_echo_service.pb.go`: [generated] stub of the service
    * `proto/examplepb/echo_service.pb.gw.go`, `proto/examplepb/a_bit_of_everything.pb.gw.go`, `proto/examplepb/uannotated_echo_service.pb.gw.go`: [generated] reverse proxy for the service
    * `proto/examplepb/unannotated_echo_service.yaml`: gRPC API Configuration for ```unannotated_echo_service.proto```
  * `server/main.go`: service implementation

  * `main.go`: entrypoint of the generated reverse proxy


  To use the same port for custom HTTP handlers (e.g. serving `swagger.json`),

  gRPC-gateway, and a gRPC server, see

  [this example by
  CoreOS](https://github.com/philips/grpc-gateway-example/blob/master/cmd/serve.go)

  (and its accompanying [blog
  post](https://coreos.com/blog/grpc-protobufs-swagger.html)).


  ## Features


  ### Supported


  * Generating JSON API handlers.

  * Method parameters in request body.

  * Method parameters in request path.

  * Method parameters in query string.

  * Enum fields in path parameter (including repeated enum fields).

  * Mapping streaming APIs to newline-delimited JSON streams.

  * Mapping HTTP headers with `Grpc-Metadata-` prefix to gRPC metadata (prefixed
  with `grpcgateway-`)

  * Optionally emitting API definitions for

  [OpenAPI (Swagger)
  v2](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/2-0/basic-structure/).

  * Setting [gRPC
  timeouts](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/PROTOCOL-HTTP2.md#requests)

  through inbound HTTP `Grpc-Timeout` header.

  * Partial support for [gRPC API
  Configuration](https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/docs/grpc/grpc-service-config)

  files as an alternative to annotation.

  * Automatically translating PATCH requests into Field Mask gRPC requests. See

  [the docs](https://grpc-ecosystem.github.io/grpc-gateway/docs/patch.html)

  for more information.


  ### No plan to support

  But patch is welcome.

  * Method parameters in HTTP headers.

  * Handling trailer metadata.

  * Encoding request/response body in XML.

  * True bi-directional streaming.


  # Mapping gRPC to HTTP


  * [How gRPC error codes map to HTTP status codes in the
  response](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/blob/master/runtime/errors.go#L15).

  * HTTP request source IP is added as `X-Forwarded-For` gRPC request header.

  * HTTP request host is added as `X-Forwarded-Host` gRPC request header.

  * HTTP `Authorization` header is added as `authorization` gRPC request header.

  * Remaining Permanent HTTP header keys (as specified by the IANA

  [here](http://www.iana.org/assignments/message-headers/message-headers.xhtml)

  are prefixed with `grpcgateway-` and added with their values to gRPC request

  header.

  * HTTP headers that start with 'Grpc-Metadata-' are mapped to gRPC metadata

  (prefixed with `grpcgateway-`).

  * While configurable, the default {un,}marshaling uses

  [jsonpb](https://godoc.org/github.com/golang/protobuf/jsonpb) with

  `OrigName: true`.

  Features

  --------------------------

  - **Supports Swagger 2.0 specs in JSON or YAML** <br>

  Swagger Express Middleware uses
  [Swagger-Parser](https://github.com/APIDevTools/swagger-parser) to parse,
  validate, and dereference Swagger files.  You can even split your spec into
  multiple different files using `$ref` pointers.


  - **Thoroughly tested**<br>

  Over 1,000 unit tests and integration tests with 100% code coverage.  Tested
  on [**over 1,000 real-world APIs**](https://apis.guru/browse-apis/) from
  Google, Instagram, Spotify, etc.  All tests are run on Mac, Linux, and Windows
  using all LTS versions of Node.


  - [**Mock
  middleware**](https://apitools.dev/swagger-express-middleware/docs/middleware/mock.html)<br>

  **Fully-functional mock** implementations for every operation in your API,
  including data persistence, all with **zero code!**  This is a great way to
  test-drive your API as you write it, or for quick demos and POCs.  You can
  even extend the mock middleware with your own logic and data to fill in any
  gaps.


  - [**Metadata
  middleware**](https://apitools.dev/swagger-express-middleware/docs/middleware/metadata.html)<br>

  Annotates each request with all the relevant information from the Swagger
  definition.  The path, the operation, the parameters, the security
  requirements - they're all easily accessible at `req.swagger`.


  - [**Parse Request
  middleware**](https://apitools.dev/swagger-express-middleware/docs/middleware/parseRequest.html)<br>

  Parses incoming requests and converts everything into the correct data types,
  according to your Swagger API definition.


  - [**Validate Request
  middleware**](https://apitools.dev/swagger-express-middleware/docs/middleware/validateRequest.html)<br>

  Ensures that every request complies with your Swagger API definition, or
  returns the appropriate HTTP error codes if needed.  Of course, you can catch
  any validation errors and handle them however you want.


  - [**CORS
  middleware**](https://apitools.dev/swagger-express-middleware/docs/middleware/CORS.html)<br>

  Adds the appropriate CORS headers to each request and automatically responds
  to CORS preflight requests, all in compliance with your Swagger API
  definition.


  - [**Files
  middleware**](https://apitools.dev/swagger-express-middleware/docs/middleware/files.html)<br>

  Serves the Swagger API file(s) in JSON or YAML format so they can be used with
  front-end tools like [Swagger UI](http://www.swagger.io), [Swagger
  Editor](http://editor.swagger.io), and [Postman](http://getpostman.com).




  Installation and Use

  --------------------------

  Install using [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm/).


  ```bash

  npm install @apidevtools/swagger-express-middleware

  ```

  Then use it in your [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) script like this:


  ```javascript

  const express = require('express');

  const createMiddleware = require('@apidevtools/swagger-express-middleware');


  let app = express();


  createMiddleware('PetStore.yaml', app, function(err, middleware) {
      // Add all the Swagger Express Middleware, or just the ones you need.
      // NOTE: Some of these accept optional options (omitted here for brevity)
      app.use(
          middleware.metadata(),
          middleware.CORS(),
          middleware.files(),
          middleware.parseRequest(),
          middleware.validateRequest(),
          middleware.mock()
      );

      app.listen(8000, function() {
          console.log('The PetStore sample is now running at http://localhost:8000');
      });
  });

  ```




  Samples & Walkthroughs

  --------------------------

  Swagger Express Middleware comes two samples that use the [Swagger Pet Store
  API](https://github.com/APIDevTools/swagger-express-middleware/blob/master/samples/PetStore.yaml).


  #### Sample 1

  This sample demonstrates the most simplistic usage of Swagger Express
  Middleware. It simply creates a new Express Application and adds all of the
  Swagger middleware without changing any options, and without adding any custom
  middleware.

  *
  [Walkthrough](https://apitools.dev/swagger-express-middleware/docs/walkthroughs/running.html)



  #### Sample 2

  This sample demonstrates a few more advanced features of Swagger Express
  Middleware, such as setting a few options, initializing the mock data store,
  and adding custom middleware logic.

  ## Development


  _Note:  One of the goals of this monorepo is to support independent package
  versions.  The author has used other popular options out there (like lerna),
  and has found independent versioning to behave strangely with them.  Another
  goal with the current approach is to reduce boilerplate code as much as
  possible (something tools like lerna don't help with).  The inspiration for
  the current approach came from
  [boennemann/alle](https://github.com/boennemann/alle).  The author isn't

  married to the current approach, so if you have ideas on how to simplify the
  development of this monorepo by all means please [open an
  issue](https://github.com/kogosoftwarellc/open-api/issues/new)._


  ### Typical Workflow for Contributors


  Let's say you're working on a package under
  [./packages](https://github.com/kogosoftwarellc/open-api/tree/master/packages). 
  Here's what you do:


  1. `cd open-api`

  1. `./bin/test packages/<package_you're_working_on>`

  1. Make your changes.
    1. _Do not bump the version in package.json._  A maintainer will handle that once your PR is merged.
  1. Once you're satisfied with your changes:
    1. Create a new branch `git checkout -b my-branch` (in case you haven't done so already).
    1. `./bin/commit packages/<package_you're_working_on> 'commit message describing your change.  can be multi line here.  just close with a single quote like so:'`
    1. Push your change to your fork
    1. Open a PR.

  ### bin


  Several scripts have been created to aid in the development of this monorepo
  (see [./bin](./bin)).  They assume that your `$PWD` is the root of the
  repository.  Here is a brief summary of common actions:


  * Testing
    * (Note: `./bin/test` will run `npm i` in the package _prior_ to running the tests)
    * Test a single package - `./bin/test packages/<package_to_test>` (starts the test in watch mode)
    * Test all packages - `./bin/test`
  * Commit changes to a package - `./bin/commit packages/<package_to_commit>
  'Commit message'` (the commit message will be prepended with the package name
  e.g. `<package_to_commit>: Commit message`


  #### dev-tools

  Scripts in this directory wrap common tools, like `nyc`, `tsc`, and `mocha`. 
  They reduce boilerplate and are called from npm scripts.

  (or a pull request :)).


  ## Requirements

  Cowboy Swagger requires Erlang 18+ after 0.1.0 version


  ## Why Cowboy Swagger?

  Simple, because there isn't a tool in Erlang to document Cowboy RESTful APIs
  easy and fast,

  and to improve development productivity.


  With `cowboy_swagger` is possible to integrate Swagger to your Erlang projects
  that use Cowboy as a web server.

  It is extremely easy to use, and with just a few steps you'll have a nice Web
  documentation for your RESTful APIs.


  To learn a bit more about Swagger, please check this [blog
  post](http://inaka.net/blog/2015/06/23/erlang-swagger-2015/).


  ## How to Use it?

  This is the best part. It is extremely easy.


  ### 1. Document each Cowboy Handler

  Because `cowboy_swagger` runs on top of `trails`, the first thing that you
  have to do

  is document all about your handler within the trails metadata. Keep in mind
  that

  all fields defined within each method into the metadata must be compliant with
  the

  [Swagger specification](http://swagger.io/specification).


  For example, suppose that you have `example_echo_handler`, so it must
  implement the `trails/0`

  callback from `trails_handler` behaviour:


  ```erlang

  trails() ->
    Metadata =
      #{get =>
        #{tags => ["echo"],
          description => "Gets echo var from the server",
          produces => ["text/plain"]
        },
        put =>
        #{tags => ["echo"],
          description => "Sets echo var in the server",
          produces => ["text/plain"],
          parameters => [
            #{name => <<"echo">>,
              description => <<"Echo message">>,
              in => <<"path">>,
              required => false,
              type => <<"string">>}
          ]
        }
      },
    [trails:trail("/message/[:echo]", example_echo_handler, [], Metadata)].
  ```


  To get a better idea of how your handler should look like, please check
  [here](./example/src/example_echo_handler.erl).


  ### 2. Include cowboy_swagger in your app

  First, you need to include `cowboy_swagger_handler` module in your list of
  trails to be compiled.


  ```erlang

  % Include cowboy_swagger_handler in the trails list

  Trails = trails:trails([example_echo_handler,
                          example_description_handler,
                          cowboy_swagger_handler]),
  % store them

  trails:store(Trails),

  % and then compile them

  Dispatch = trails:single_host_compile(Trails),

  ```


  The snippet of code above is usually placed when you start `cowboy`. Check it
  [here](./example/src/example.erl#L31).


  Then add `cowboy_swagger` to the list of apps to be loaded in your `*.app.src`
  file.


  ```erlang

  {application, example,
   [
    {description, "Cowboy Swagger Basic Example."},
    {vsn, "0.1"},
    {applications,
     [kernel,
      stdlib,
      jsx,
      cowboy,
      trails,
      cowboy_swagger
     ]},
    {modules, []},
    {mod, {example, []}},
    {registered, []},
    {start_phases, [{start_trails_http, []}]}
   ]
  }.

  ```


  And that's it, you got it. Now start your application and then you will have
  access to the API docs

  under the path `/api-docs`. Supposing that you're running the app on
  `localhost:8080`,

  that will be [http://localhost:8080/api-docs](http://localhost:8080/api-docs).


  ## Configuration


  Additionally, `cowboy_swagger` can be configured/customized from a `*.config`
  file:


  ### app.config


  ```erlang

  [
   %% Other apps ...

   %% cowboy_swagger config
   {cowboy_swagger,
    [
     %% `static_files`: Static content directory. This is where Swagger-UI
     %% is located. Default: `priv/swagger`.
     %% Remember that Swagger-UI is embedded into `cowboy-swagger` project,
     %% within `priv/swagger` folder. BUT you have to reference that path,
     %% and depending on how you're using `cowboy-swagger` it will be different.
     %% For example, assuming that you want to run your app which has
     %% `cowboy-swagger` as dependency from the console, `static_files` will be:
     {static_files, "./deps/cowboy_swagger/priv/swagger"},

     %% `global_spec`: Global fields for Swagger specification.
     %% If these fields are not set, `cowboy_swagger` will set default values.
     {global_spec,
      #{swagger => "2.0",
        info => #{title => "Example API"},
        basePath => "/api-docs"
       }
     }
    ]
   }
  ].

  ```


  ### Definitions


  [Definitions](http://swagger.io/specification/#definitionsObject) can be used
  for describing

  [parameters](http://swagger.io/specification/#parametersDefinitionsObject),

  [responses](http://swagger.io/specification/#responsesDefinitionsObject) and

  [security](http://swagger.io/specification/#securityDefinitionsObject)
  schemas.


  For adding definitions to your app, you have 2 choices:


  1. Add a `definitions` key to your cowboy_swagger `global_spec` map.

  2. Add them by calling `cowboy_swagger:add_definition/2` and send the
     definition's name and properties.

  Let's say you want to describe a `POST` call to a `newspapers` endpoint that
  requires

  `name` and `description` fields only, you can do it like this:


  **Option 1:**

  ```erlang

  [ ... % other configurations

  , { cowboy_swagger
    , [ { global_spec
        , #{ swagger => "2.0"
           , info => #{title => "My app API"}
           , definitions => #{
               "RequestBody" =>
                 #{ "name" =>
                     #{ "type" => "string"
                      , "description" => "Newspaper name"
                      }
                  , "description" =>
                      #{ "type" => "string"
                       , "description" => "Newspaper description"
                       }
                  }
             }
           }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]

  ```


  **Option 2:**


  For the second choice, you can do it for example in one or several
  `start_phases`,

  directly in your handler or any other place you want.


  ```erlang

  -spec trails() -> trails:trails().

  trails() ->
    DefinitionName = <<"RequestBody">>,
    DefinitionProperties =
      #{ <<"name">> =>
           #{ type => <<"string">>
            , description => <<"Newspaper name">>
            }
       , <<"description">> =>
           #{ type => <<"string">>
            , description => <<"Newspaper description">>
            }
       },
    % Add the definition
    ok = cowboy_swagger:add_definition(DefinitionName, DefinitionProperties),
    ...
  ```



  Now in your handler's trails callback function you can use it:


  ```erlang

  ...
    RequestBody =
      #{ name => <<"request body">>
       , in => body
       , description => <<"request body (as json)">>
       , required => true
         % Use the previously created `RequestBody' definition
       , schema => cowboy_swagger:schema(<<"RequestBody">>)
       },
    Metadata =
      #{ get =>
         #{ tags => ["newspapers"]
          , description => "Returns the list of newspapers"
          , produces => ["application/json"]
          }
       , post =>
         # { tags => ["newspapers"]
           , description => "Creates a new newspaper"
           , consumes => ["application/json"]
           , produces => ["application/json"]
           , parameters => [RequestBody] % and then use that parameter here
           }
       },
    Path = "/newspapers",
    Options = #{path => Path},
    [trails:trail(Path, newspapers_handler, Options, Metadata)].
  ```


  What this does for you is add a nice `response`, `parameter` or `security`

  model in swagger-ui, so client developers will know exactly what parameters

  the API expects for every endpoint.

  [swagger.io](http://swagger.io/) (v2.0) hook for Sails. The application's
  models, controllers, and routes are aggregated and transformed into a Swagger
  Document. Supports the Swagger 2.0 specification.


  ## Install


  ```sh

  $ npm install sails-swagger --save

  ```


  ## Configuration

  ```js

  // config/swagger.js

  module.exports.swagger = {
    /**
     * require() the package.json file for your Sails app.
     */
    pkg: require('../package'),
    ui: {
      url: 'http://swagger.balderdash.io'
    }
  };

  ```


  ## Usage

  After installing and configuring swagger, you can find the docs output on the
  [/swagger/doc](http://localhost:1337/swagger/doc) route.


  You may also specify additional swagger endpoints by specifying the swagger
  spec in config/routes.js


  ```

  /**
   * Route Mappings
   * @file config/routes.js
   * (sails.config.routes)
   *
   * Your routes map URLs to views and controllers.
   */

  module.exports.routes = {

  ## swagger1st: A Swagger-First Clojure Ring handler


  ![Maven
  Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/org.zalando/swagger1st.svg)

  [![Build
  Status](https://travis-ci.org/zalando-stups/swagger1st.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zalando-stups/swagger1st)

  [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/zalando-stups/swagger1st/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/zalando-stups/swagger1st)


  swagger1st is a Clojure [Ring](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring) handler
  that parses, validates and routes requests

  based on your [Swagger](http://swagger.io/)/OpenAPI definition. It takes the
  opposite approach of
  [ring-swagger](https://github.com/metosin/ring-swagger)—which enables you to
  generate your Swagger spec from your Clojure code—by allowing you to use your
  Swagger spec to generate Clojure code.


  Instead of defining routes and validation rules in your code, you can use
  swagger1st along with [Swagger/OpenAPI's great tool
  set](http://editor.swagger.io/) to specify your API according to the
  [Swagger/Open API 2.0
  Specification](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec). This enables you
  to specify your API in an API-First, technology-independent format. The
  resulting definition is the ultimate format for publishing, sharing and
  reviewing your API.


  #### Compatibility Overview

  swagger1st aims to implement all of the Swagger/OpenAPI spec's features, so
  that you only have to write your business logic. [This
  document](https://github.com/zalando-stups/swagger1st/blob/master/comp-2.0.md)
  shows which aspects of the spec it currently supports.


  swagger1st will use the Swagger definition of your API as a configuration file
  for processing incoming requests—ensuring that your implementation and
  specification always remain in sync. During runtime, you can inspect and
  easily test

  your API with the built-in [Swagger UI](http://petstore.swagger.io/). You can
  also extend the interpretation of

  your definition according to your own needs.


  Imagine a simple API definition like this:


  ```yaml

  swagger: '2.0'


  info:
    title: Example API
    version: '0.1'

  paths:
    /helloworld:
      get:
        summary: Returns a greeting.
        operationId: example.api/generate-greeting
        parameters:
          - name: firstname
            in: query
            type: string
            pattern: "^[A-Z][a-z]+"
        responses:
            200:
                description: say hello
  ```


  By default, this definition is connected to your business logic via the
  `operationId`, which might be defined like so:


  ```clojure

  (ns example.api
    (:require [ring.util.response :as r]))

  (defn generate-greeting [request]
    (let [firstname (-> request :parameters :query :firstname)]
      (-> (r/response (str "Hello " firstname "!"))
          (r/content-type "plain/text"))))
  ```


  This is all you need to do to define and implement your API. Only fully
  validated requests get to your function,

  so you can rely on swagger1st to properly check all input parameters according
  to your definition. The function itself

  is a normal Clojure function without any dependencies to swagger1st - simple
  as that.


  ### Quickstart


  The following provides instructions for simple, complex and manual setups. For
  all three approaches you'll need to install [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org/)
  as the build tool.


  #### Simple Setup

  If you're bootstrapping a completely new project, or just want to try out
  swagger1st, you can use this Leiningen template:


  ```

  $ lein new swagger1st myproject

  $ cd myproject

  $ lein ring server-headless

  ```


  This will run a local web server on port 3000, so you can interact with the
  API at <http://localhost:3000/>. Also, you might want to have a look at
  <http://localhost:3000/ui/> for a graphical interface to explore and
  experiment with your API (using [Swagger UI](http://petstore.swagger.io/)).


  ### Complex Setup


  To see how you can handle dependency injection with swagger1st, generate a
  project setup that includes Stuart Sierra's

  [component](https://github.com/stuartsierra/component) framework:


  ```

  $ lein new swagger1st myproject +component

  $ cd myproject

  $ lein run -m myproject.core

  ```


  As with the simple setup above, this will launch a local web server on port
  3000.


  ### Manual Setup


  The following steps describe how to manually set up swagger1st in a Clojure
  project. This is especially useful if you want to integrate it into an
  existing project or cannot use the provided template for other reasons.


  Use the following dependency in your [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org/)
  project:

      [org.zalando/swagger1st "<latest>"]

  This creates a Ring-compliant handler:


  ```clojure

  (ns example
    (:require [io.sarnowski.swagger1st.core :as s1st]
              [io.sarnowski.swagger1st.util.security :as s1stsec]))

  (def app
    (-> (s1st/context :yaml-cp "my-swagger-api.yaml")
        (s1st/discoverer)
        (s1st/mapper)
        (s1st/parser)
        (s1st/protector {"oauth2" (s1stsec/allow-all)})
        (s1st/executor)))
  ```


  ### Commands for Development


  ```shell

  # get the source

  $ git clone https://github.com/zalando-stups/swagger1st.git

  $ cd swagger1st


  # run the tests

  $ lein test


  # run all tests, including performance benchmarks

  $ lein test :all


  # build an own artifact for local development

  $ lein install


  # release a new version

  $ lein release :minor

  ```


  For interactive development, you can start a REPL by typing `lein repl`.


  ### Projects Using Swagger1st in Production


  - [Friboo](https://github.com/zalando/friboo), a utility library for writing
  microservices in Clojure, with support for Swagger and OAuth. It uses
  swagger1st at its base for RESTful HTTP endpoints and also integrates with the
  [component](https://github.com/stuartsierra/component) framework.

  - [STUPS.io](https://stups.io/) components
  [Kio](https://github.com/zalando-stups/kio),
  [PierOne](https://github.com/zalando-stups/pierone) (a complete Docker
  registry based on S3),
  [Essentials](https://github.com/zalando-stups/essentials),
  [TWINTIP](https://github.com/zalando-stups/twintip-storage) and
  [mint](https://github.com/zalando-stups/mint-storage)


  ### The Ring Handler in Detail


  * `s1st/context` (required)
      * Creates a new context from a given definition. This context will be used by the next steps to prepare the
        execution of requests.
  * `s1st/discoverer` (optional)
      * The discoverer enables certain HTTP endpoints, that makes it easy to work with your API. In particular, this
        enables the Swagger UI under the path `/ui/` and exposes the Swagger definition under `/swagger.json`.
  * `s1st/mapper` (required)
      * The mapper denormalizes the given definition (e.g. resolves all `$ref`s) and figures out, which request definition
        maps to the actual incoming request. After this function, your `request` map contains the `:swagger` key, which
        contains a `:request` key containing the denormalized definition of the request and a `:key` key which can be used
        to uniquely identify a request.
  * `s1st/parser` (required)
      * The parser parses the incoming request according to the definition and validates all inputs.
  * `s1st/protector` (optional)
      * The protector can enforce all security definitions for you. As the security check implementations vary depending
        on your environment, this is only a framework to hook into the system and define callbacks for the actual checks.
  * `s1st/executor` (required)
      * The executor executes your defined function in the end. At this point, the whole definition was validated and only
        valid requests make it up until here. You can also specify an own function resolver function in order to hook into
        your own framework.

  * `to` - desired format (see formats below)

  * `source` - Filename, URL, or JS object for the source

  ### Simple example:

  ```js

  var Converter = require('api-spec-converter');


  Converter.convert({
    from: 'swagger_1',
    to: 'swagger_2',
    source: 'https://api.gettyimages.com/swagger/api-docs',
  }, function(err, converted) {
    console.log(converted.stringify());
    // For yaml and/or OpenApi field order output replace above line

  This library has full support for both callback and promises.

  All async functions return promises but also will execute callback if
  provided.


  ```js

  var Converter = require('api-spec-converter');


  Converter.convert({
    from: 'swagger_1',
    to: 'swagger_2',
    source: 'https://api.gettyimages.com/swagger/api-docs',
  })

  .then(function(converted) {
    console.log(converted.stringify());
  });

  ```

    source: 'https://api.gettyimages.com/swagger/api-docs',
  })
    .then(function(converted) {
      // [Optional] Fill missing fields with dummy values
      converted.fillMissing();

      // [Optional] Validate converted spec
      return converted.validate()
        .then(function (result) {
          if (result.errors)
            return console.error(JSON.stringify(errors, null, 2));
          if (result.warnings)
            return console.error(JSON.stringify(warnings, null, 2));

          fs.writeFileSync('swagger2.json', converted.stringify());
        });
    });
  ```

  ## Status


  This plugin should be enabled using the
  [play-swagger-service](http://www.typesafe.com/activator/template/play-swagger-service)
  activator template 

  as the version in this repository is under active development. The status of
  this software is beta, 

  an end-to-end functional release intended to demonstrate the possibility to
  generate following from a Swagger specification:


  - Play route files

  - Generators of random test data

  - Wrappers for Play route files to convert semantics from http-related to
  domain-related (controller_base)

  - Skeletons for the domain-driven controller implementation

  - Model classes and validation rules

  - Unit tests for invalid and valid parameter sets

  - Security extractors (if needed)

  - Skeletons for custom deserializers (if needed)


  We benefit from community feedback. All comments are welcome!


  # Play-Swagger Tutorial


  This tutorial is based on the
  [play-swagger-service](http://www.typesafe.com/activator/template/play-swagger-service)
  activator template.


  ```bash

  $ activator new playground play-swagger-service

  ```


  The template project contains following:


  - `tutorial` folder with HTML tutorial

  - `public/swagger` folder containing static files needed for swagger UI

  - `project` folder containing pre-configured `plugins.sbt` file with a
  definition of all required resolvers and plugins

  - `conf` folder with following customized contents:
      * `routes` file with route configuration for Swagger UI, example specification and commented out links to other examples
      * `example.yaml`, a demo Swagger specification. The specification has a dummy implementation in `app` folder. 
      * `examples` folder containing other different Swagger specification examples. Each specification in this folder represents some aspect of the Play-Swagger plugin in more details.
          For the specification to be picked up by the plugin it must be moved into the `conf` folder. It is allowed to have multiple Swagger specifications in the `conf` folder at the same time. 
  - `app` directory with following template implementations:
      * `controllers/Swagger.scala` - a backend side of the Swagger UI
      * `generated_controllers/example.yaml.scala` - a dummy implementation of the example controller. Will be (re)generated if deleted
      * `security/example.yaml.scala` - a marshaller for OAuth2 tokens. Will not be regenerated until 
          a) deleted or renamed
          b) explicitly requested by issuing a `apiFirstSecurity` command 


  ## Welcome to Play-Swagger


  Congratulations, you just created a new Play-Swagger application!


  The [Play Framework](http://www.playframework.com/) with the
  [Play-Swagger](https://github.com/zalando/play-Swagger/) 

  plugin make it easy to build RESTful web services from a Swagger API
  specification as the single source of truth. 

  Play is based on a lightweight, stateless, web-friendly architecture. Built on
  [Akka](http://akka.io), 

  Play provides predictable and minimal resource consumption for highly-scalable
  applications. 

  The Play-Swagger plugin takes Swagger API definitions and treats them as the
  single source of truth of your REST services.


  Play-Swagger supports round-trip regeneration and compilation of:


  - Play routes definitions (managed).

  - Swagger domain model definitions and parameters onto Scala case classes
  (managed).

  - Swagger domain model constraints onto Play validations (managed).

  - Generators for random test data generation of parameter values (managed).

  - Unit tests for validating your service at the API boundary (managed).

  - Swagger path definitions onto skeletons for Play controller implementations
  (unmanaged).


  In the list above, "(managed)" means that the code is managed by sbt. The code
  is not controlled 

  and altered by you, the programmer of the REST service. The plugin takes your
  Swagger API definition as the single 

  source of truth and regenerates these code parts in a consistent manner.

  You'll instead be focusing on implementing the service business logic in an
  (unmanaged) Play controller class 

  that is generated once. Subsequent regenerations keep the code that you have
  added, either by commenting out the 

  parts that are no longer valid, or by adding parts that are needed because you
  have made a change to the API.


  Manual generation and compilation of:


  - Security extractors

  - Unmarshallers for custom content types 


  is supported in the case if


  a) No security extractor or unmarshaller with the same name already exists

  b) The developer issues `apiFirstSecurity` or `apiFirstMarshallers` sbt
  command 


  ## Run Your Application


  Before we go any further, let's run the application.


  - Open a shell and `cd` into your service project directory.

  - Start `sbt` and `run` the service.

  - View the running application at
  [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000).


  The service template comes with the Swagger UI frontend included, 

  run statically from the within Play, which provides a sandbox for your
  service. 

  The template is configured with a template Swagger API definition called
  `example.yaml` 

  and located in the `conf` directory of the Play application. 


  The `example.yaml` definition provides an example [API
  description](https://github.com/zalando/play-swagger-service/blob/master/conf/example.yaml)


  This definition contains three end points: 

  - the `/token` path, which accept the `GET` and `POST` methods

  - the `/todos/{user_id}`, which accepts the `GET` method. 


  The `GET /token` API plays a role of an authentication server and is used by
  the Swagger UI for OAuth token requests.

  The `POST /token` API represents an authorization server and is used by the
  security part of the 

  generated code to validate OAuth tokens.
   
  The `GET /todos/{user_id}` takes a path parameter `user_id` and returns a TODO
  list for given user. 

  For the client to be allowed to access this endpoint, it must provide an OAuth
  token with the scope `admin:org`. 

  The token can be requested using the Swagger UI.


  Try it out for yourself: 


  Click the [default](http://localhost:9000/) button to expand the API
  definition in the Swagger UI.



  # Play Routes Integration


  As a Play application developer, you are used to defining your endpoints in
  the `conf/routes` file. 

  Not so with the Play-Swagger plugin! Swagger API specifications already define
  endpoints as `path` definitions, 

  as seen in the example above. So why do the work twice, right? Instead, the
  Play-Swagger plugin requires you to 

  link your API definition in the routes file ones—making all Swagger
  API-defined endpoints available as children 

  of one single path context location, and generating Play route definitions
  from them (as shown below):


  ```

  ->      /example        example.yaml.Routes

  ```


  Note that the `conf/routes` file provided by this activator template also
  contains a couple of additional `GET` 

  mappings required for the the Swagger UI sandbox.


  There are a couple of commented out links to other examples. If you activate
  some specification by moving it from 

  the `examples` folder into the `conf` folder, you'll need to uncomment an
  appropriate line in the `routes` file in

  order for play to be able to find it.  



  ## Swagger Domain Definitions


  Scala domain model definitions are generated for all data types defined as
  Swagger parameters in an API specification. 

  Swagger parameters can be of path, query, header, form or body types, and
  consist of either primitive data types or 

  more complex types composed from objects and arrays with primitives as
  leaves. 


  Both primitive types and complex types are mapped to scala.


  As an example, let's look at the Swagger API specification file
  [`simple.petstore.api.yaml`](https://github.com/zalando/play-swagger-service/blob/master/conf/examples/simple.petstore.api.yaml), 

  which defines the API of a simple pet store. It contains a model definition
  for a pet.


  ```yaml

  definitions:
    pet:
      required:
        - id
        - name
      properties:
        id:
          type: integer
          format: int64
        name:
          type: string
        tag:
          type: string
  ```


  This definition consists of an object `pet` containing the required properties
  `id` and `name` 

  and the optional property `tag`. The Swagger primitive types of these
  properties are a 64-bit `integer` 

  and (twice) a `string`, successively.  The Play-Swagger plugin will map this
  definition on to a generated Scala model.


  ```scala

  package simple.petstore.api


  package object yaml {

      type PetTag = Option[String]

      case class Pet(id: Long, name: String, tag: PetTag)
  }

  ```


  This generated model contains a type definition `PetTag`, which declares a
  type alias for the optional `tag` property, 

  and a `Pet` case class with the properties as named in the Swagger API
  definition and mapped on the subsequent 

  Scala primitive or declared types. The case class and type alias are generated
  in an package object `yaml`, 

  this package  object itself is contained in the package `simple.petstore.api`
  so that full object name corresponds 

  to the API filename.


  Note that models are generated within a Play application as _managed_ code in
  the target folder. 

  Generated model code is not intended to be altered.  We should instead look
  upon the Swagger definition as the single 

  source of truth, and as the source code that defines our model.

  The Swagger specification file of our API is, in that sense, part of the
  codebase. 

  Even though the generated `Pet` case class is managed by the plugin, and not
  us, it can (of course) 

  be used in our application codebase after being imported.


  ```scala

  import simple.petstore.api.yaml._


  val pet = Pet(0L, "Tucker", Some("Greyhound"))

  ```


  ## Specification Cross-References


  A `$ref` element of the specification is allowed to contain a name of file as
  it's part. Because of this, it is possible to split 

  a single specification into multiple files as shown in
  [`cross_spec_references.yaml`](https://github.com/zalando/play-swagger-service/blob/master/conf/examples/cross_spec_references.yaml) 

  example. It is also possible to reference a definition in one specification
  from another specification. 

  In this case for each reference an independent copy of the class definition
  will be created for each referencing specification. 

  The definition is then placed into the appropriate package for each
  specification. 


  Thus, even if multiple classes with  the same name and structure might be
  generated, they all will coexist in their 

  own separate namespaces and won't be interchangeable.



  ## Primitive Types


  Swagger version 2.0 allows for primitive data types based on the types defined
  by 

  [JSON-Schema](http://json-schema.org/latest/json-schema-core.html#anchor8).


  When generated as Scala, the following mapping applies:


  | Common Name | Swagger Type | Swagger Format | Scala
  Type                                  |

  |-------------|--------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------|

  | integer     | integer      | int32          |
  scala.Int                                   |

  | long        | integer      | int64          |
  scala.Long                                  |

  | float       | number       | float          |
  scala.Float                                 |

  | double      | number       | double         |
  scala.Double                                |

  | big int     | integer      |                |
  scala.math.BigInt                           |

  | big decimal | number       |                |
  scala.math.BigDecimal                       |

  | boolean     | boolean      |                |
  scala.Boolean                               |

  | string      | string       |                |
  scala.String                                |

  | byte        | string       | byte           |
  de.zalando.play.controllers.Base64String    |

  | binary      | string       | binary         |
  de.zalando.play.controllers.BinaryString    |

  | date        | string       | date           |
  org.joda.time.LocalDate                     |

  | datetime    | string       | date-time      |
  org.joda.time.DateTime                      |

  | password    | string       | password       |
  scala.String                                |

  | file        | file         |                |
  java.io.File                                |


  Additionally, if a validation of type "enum" is defined for some primitive
  type, a trait and a set of case objects forming an ADT 

  will be generated for this enum.


  ## Complex Types


  Complex types are made up of primitive objects, or nested objects.


  ### Objects


  Complex object types are defined in Swagger model definitions as either
  objects or arrays.


  Objects are, again, based on the
  [JSON-Schema](http://json-schema.org/latest/json-schema-core.html#anchor8)
  specification 

  and defined as Swagger [Schema
  Objects](https://github.com/Swagger-api/Swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#schema-object) 

  for parameter definitions of `type: "object"`.

  For example, given a Swagger API definition file `api.yaml` containing a model
  that defines a `person` as an object 

  with the properties `name` and `age` of the primitive types `string` and
  `integer` subsequently, 

  this object will be mapped on a Scala case class, and generated in a Scala
  package object (namespace) with the same name 

  as the extension of the file the specification is read from and in a package
  with the same name as the 

  Swagger definition file in which the model is defined—that is, `api`


  ```yaml

  definitions:
    person:
      type: object
      required:
        - name
        - age
      properties:
        name:
          type: string
        age:
          type: integer
          format: int32
  ```


  Is generated into:


  ```scala

  package api

  package object yaml {
      case class Person(name: String, age: Int) 
  }

  ```


  ### Nested Objects


  Nested objects are generated adjourned but referenced hierarchically. E.g.


  ```yaml

  definitions:
    parent:
      type: object
      required:
        - child
      properties:
        child:
          type: object
          required:
            - name
          properties:
            name:
              type: string
  ```


  Is generated into:


  ```scala

  package api

  package object yaml {
      case class Parent(child: ParentChild) 
      case class ParentChild(name: String) 
  }


  ```


  ### Optionality


  Swagger, by default, defines object properties to be optional, which can be
  overridden by providing a list of `required` 

  object properties as already used in the examples above. Optional properties
  are mapped upon Scala's `Option` type, 

  for which a type alias is generated for each property that is optional. E.g.


  ```yaml

  definitions:
    product:
      required:
        - name
      properties:
        name:
          type: string
        tag:
          type: string
  ```


  Which is generated as:


  ```scala

  package api

  package object yaml {
      type ProductTag = Option[String]
      case class Product(name: String, tag: ProductTag) 
  }


  ```


  As objects can be nested, so can object property optionality. To facilitate
  for nested optionality, we generate a nested scala `Option` type alias. E.g.


  ```yaml

  definitions:
    Basic:
      properties:
        optional:
          type: object
          properties:
            nested:
              type: string
  ```


  Which is generated as:


  ```scala

  package api

  package object yaml {
      type BasicOptional = Option[BasicOptionalOpt]
      type BasicOptionalNested = Option[String]

      case class BasicOptionalOpt(nested: BasicOptionalNested) 
      case class Basic(optional: BasicOptional) 
  }

  ```



  ### Parameter optionality


  As object properties can be optional, so can be query, header, body or form
  parameters. 

  In the case if they are not required, they are mapped to the Scala's `Option`
  type. 


  Path parameters are _must_ be declared as required.


  In the case, if a parameter is _not_ required, it is allowed to have a default
  value.



  ### Extension


  Objects can extend other objects via employment of Swagger's `allOff`
  property. In the example below, the `ExtendedErrorModel` inherits _all of_ the
  properties of the `ErrorModel` which it refers to—that is, the properties
  `message` and `code`—and _extends_ this model with the property `rootCause`.
  Swagger object extension is mapped by duplicating inherited properties in the
  object that extends. E.g.


  ```yaml

  definitions:
    ErrorModel:
      type: object
      required:
      - message
      - code
      properties:
        message:
          type: string
        code:
          type: integer
    ExtendedErrorModel:
      allOf:
      - $ref: '#/definitions/ErrorModel'
      - type: object
        required:
        - rootCause
        properties:
          rootCause:
            type: string
  ```


  Which is generated as:


  ```scala

  package api

  package object yaml {
    import scala.math.BigInt
    case class ErrorModel(message: String, code: BigInt) 
    case class ExtendedErrorModel(message: String, code: BigInt, rootCause: String) 
  }


  ```


  ### Polymorphism


  Polymorphic object definitions are possible through employment of the Swagger
  `discriminator` property. 

  In the example definition below, an abstract `Pet` defines what concrete `Cat`
  and `Dog`s have in common. 

  Swagger object models define data, so a discriminator property is required to
  distinguish concrete cat and dog 

  instances as they are serialised to and from the API. In this sense, the
  discriminator property works 

  in the same way as a discriminator column works in ORM frameworks when mapping
  a class hierarchy onto a single table. 

  It simply contains a value that maps onto one of the concrete types—for
  example, `petType: "Cat"` or `petType: "Dog"`.


  ```yaml

  definitions:
    Pet:
      discriminator: petType
      properties:
        name:
          type: string
        petType:
          type: string
      required:
      - name
      - petType
    Cat:
      allOf:
      - $ref: '#/definitions/Pet'
      - properties:
          huntingSkill:
            type: string
            default: lazy
            enum:
            - clueless
            - lazy
            - adventurous
            - aggressive
        required:
        - huntingSkill
    Dog:
      allOf:
      - $ref: '#/definitions/Pet'
      - properties:
          packSize:
            type: integer
            format: int32
        required:
        - packSize
  ```


  Which is generated as:


  ```scala

  package api


  package object yaml {

      trait IPet {
          def name: String
          def petType: String
      }

      case class Cat(name: String, petType: String, huntingSkill: CatHuntingSkill) extends IPet
      case class Dog(name: String, petType: String, packSize: Int) extends IPet
      case class Pet(name: String, petType: String) extends IPet

      sealed trait CatHuntingSkill { def value: String }
      case object Clueless extends CatHuntingSkill { val value = "clueless" }
      case object Lazy extends CatHuntingSkill { val value = "lazy" }
      case object Adventurous extends CatHuntingSkill { val value = "adventurous" }
      case object Aggressive extends CatHuntingSkill { val value = "aggressive" }
      implicit def stringToCatHuntingSkill(in: String): CatHuntingSkill = in match {
          case "clueless" => Clueless
          case "lazy" => Lazy
          case "adventurous" => Adventurous
          case "aggressive" => Aggressive
      }
  }


  ```


  Please note how the enumeration of cat's `huntingSkill`'s get's translated
  into the ADT with a sealed trait `CatHuntingSkill`

  and four case objects implementing that trait.


  ### Additional Properties


  Swagger's model language allows objects' additional properties to be loosely
  defined employing the `additionalProperties` annotation 

  in order to model dictionaries. These dictionaries are mapped to Scala's `Map`
  type, for which a type alias is 

  generated following the same (by now) well-known pattern as for optional
  properties, with the map's key parameter type being a Scala `String`.


  A Swagger additional property definition takes as its type property the
  element type of the dictionary, 

  which can be of primitive or complex type and which is mapped on Scala as the
  map's value parameter type. 

  Swagger allows for one `additionalProperties` annotation per object
  definition, so we can generate this Scala parameter 

  with the static name `additionalProperties`.


  In the following example we define a Swagger model object definition
  `KeyedArray` that uses the `additionalProperties` 

  annotation to provide the object with a set of key value mappings from string
  to array. E.g.


  ```yaml

  definitions:
    KeyedArrays:
      type: object
      additionalProperties:
        type: array
        items:
          type: integer
  ```


  Which is generated as:


  ```scala

  package api


  package object yaml {

      import de.zalando.play.controllers.ArrayWrapper
      import scala.math.BigInt
      import scala.collection.immutable.Map

      type KeyedArraysAdditionalPropertiesCatchAll = ArrayWrapper[BigInt]
      type KeyedArraysAdditionalProperties = Map[String, KeyedArraysAdditionalPropertiesCatchAll]
      case class KeyedArrays(additionalProperties: KeyedArraysAdditionalProperties) 
  }

  ```


  ## Arrays


  Swagger's `array` is used to define properties that hold sets or lists of
  model values—possibly of a primitive type, 

  but complex element types are also allowed. Depending on the place where the
  array definition appears, Swagger array can be mapped to one of two Scala
  types, parametrised for the element type that it contains:

  - if an array only defined inline as a part of the response definition, it is
  translated to a `Seq` type

  - otherwise (array appears in the parameter definition or in the `definitions`
  part of the specification) it is 

  defined as a `de.zalando.play.controllers.ArrayWrapper`


  For example, in the snippet below, an `Activity` object definition is referred
  to as an item element in the 

  `messages` property of `type: array` of the containing object definition
  `Example`. 

  A Scala type alias will be generated for the array type (just as we've seen
  before with optional properties), 

  after which the array-containing property can be generated within the case
  class as being of this alias type. 

  E.g. in the Swagger definition and code


  ```yaml

  definitions:
    Activity:
      type: object
      required:
      - actions
      properties:
        actions:
          type: string
    Example:
      type: object
      required:
      - messages
      properties:
        messages:
          type: array
          items:
            $ref: '#/definitions/Activity'
  ```


  Which is generated as:


  ```scala

  package api


  package object yaml {

      import de.zalando.play.controllers.ArrayWrapper

      type ExampleMessages = ArrayWrapper[Activity]

      case class Activity(actions: String) 
      case class Example(messages: ExampleMessages) 
  }


  ```


  If the description of the same array is inlined as a part of the response
  definition like that:


  ```yaml

  paths:
    /api:
      get:
        responses:
          200:
            schema:
              type: object
              required:
              - messages
              properties:
                messages:
                  type: array
                  items:
                    $ref: '#/definitions/Activity'
            description: array payload
  definitions:
    Activity:
      type: object
      required:
      - actions
      properties:
        actions:
          type: string
  ```


  than the `Seq` scala type will be used:

  ```scala

  package api

  package object yaml {
      type ApiGetResponses200Messages = Seq[Activity]
      case class Activity(actions: String) 
      case class ApiGetResponses200(messages: ApiGetResponses200Messages) 
  }

  ```



  ### Nested Arrays


  Array definition types can be nested and are possibly optional. 

  The following (contrived) snippet depicts the generated Scala code when both
  definition types are 

  employed in a somewhat non-useful manner. The intent of this example is to
  show that the case 

  class definitions are rather concisely generated, even though a stack of type
  aliases is needed 

  to make sure that we still refer in Scala code to an aptly named Swagger
  definition—especially 

  in conjunction with the object properties being optional. Next to its
  benefits, 

  type safety against `null` pointers does have an associated cost as well.


  ```yaml

  definitions:
    Activity:
      type: object
      properties:
        actions:
          type: string
    Example:
      type: object
      properties:
        messages:
          type: array
          items:
            type: array
            items:
              $ref: '#/definitions/Activity'
        nested:
          type: array
          items:
            type: array
            items:
              type: array
              items:
                type: array
                items:
                  type: string
  ```


  Which is generated as:


  ```scala

  package api


  package object yaml {

      import de.zalando.play.controllers.ArrayWrapper

      type ExampleMessagesOpt = ArrayWrapper[ExampleMessagesOptArr]
      type ExampleMessages = Option[ExampleMessagesOpt]
      type ExampleNested = Option[ExampleNestedOpt]
      type ExampleMessagesOptArr = ArrayWrapper[Activity]
      type ExampleNestedOptArrArrArr = ArrayWrapper[String]
      type ExampleNestedOptArrArr = ArrayWrapper[ExampleNestedOptArrArrArr]
      type ActivityActions = Option[String]
      type ExampleNestedOptArr = ArrayWrapper[ExampleNestedOptArrArr]
      type ExampleNestedOpt = ArrayWrapper[ExampleNestedOptArr]

      case class Activity(actions: ActivityActions) 
      case class Example(messages: ExampleMessages, nested: ExampleNested) 
  }


  ```


  ## Swagger Validations


  Swagger API definitions allow for constraints to be put on parameter types. 

  We have already seen the `required` constraint, used to mark a parameter or
  specific field within 

  a domain definition to be required upon input. Additional constraints, as
  defined by the 

  [Parameter
  Object](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#parameterObject), 

  can be added to your API definition. The Play-Swagger plugin will generate
  validations for these parameter 

  constraints and make sure that your controller methods are only called if the
  input of your service 

  complies to those constraints. 


  In the example below, the API definition of the `token` parameter of 

  type `Base64String`, as the form parameter, contains validation rules for the
  lenght of the perameter as well as a regexp pattern the value of the parameter
  must confirm to.

  The parameter is also required.


  ```yaml

  ...

  parameters:
        - name: token
          in: formData
          description: oauth2 token
          type: string
          format: byte
          pattern: "[A-Za-z0-9]*"
          minLength: 5
          maxLength: 100
          required: true
  ...

  ```


  Let's take another example:


  ```yaml

  ...
      get:
        parameters:
        - name: state
          in: query
          description: Any application state to be forwarded back to the frontend
          type: string
          minLength: 1
          maxLength: 110
          required: false
  ...

  ```


  The `state` parameter is of type string, is not required and has no default
  value. 

  It is also only allowed to have a state of length between 1 and 110, otherwise
  it won't pass validation. 

  For the demo purposes, let's change it's type to `integer` and make it
  required. 


  As the parameter is required now, the `default` value cannot be present. The
  `maxLength` and `maxLength` validations 

  are not allowed for integer parameters, therefore let's replace them with
  `minimum` and `maximum` values:
      
  ```yaml

  ...
      get:
        parameters:
        - name: state
          in: query
          description: Any application state to be forwarded back to the frontend
          type: integer
          format: int32
          required: true
          minimum: 2000
          maximum: 2100      
  ...

  ```    



  As we just changed the parameter type, refreshing Swagger UI will, in addition
  to generating validations 

  for that parameter type, also force a regeneration of the model consistent
  with the validation. 

  That's nice, but note that it will break the current implementation of the
  controller class, as the 

  implementation of the `postAction` expects `state` to be of type `String`.


  ![Validation screenshot](/docs/validations-01.png)


  Let's change the implementation. The second parameter `state` is no longer 

  of type `Option[String]` but of type `Int`. We change the implementation to
  take this fact into the account:


  ```scala

  ...

  val tokenGet = tokenGetAction { input: (String, String, String, Int) =>
      val (redirect_uri, scope, response_type, state) = input
      // ----- Start of unmanaged code area for action  TokenService.tokenGet
      val statePart = s"""state=$state"""
  ...

  }

  ```


  Refreshing Swagger UI and trying out a couple of integer values for `state`
  shows that the service 

  now excepts value within the range `[2000..2100]`, but returns a descriptive
  error when outside. I.e.


  ```json

  [
    {
      "messages": [
        "error.max"
      ],
      "args": [
        2100
      ]
    }
  ]

  ```


  ## Test Generators


  Having an API definition as the single source of truth in your codebase—with
  formal type specification of the in- and output values, 

  including their constraints—provides for a powerful feature when it comes to
  testing. 

  The Play-Swagger plugin automates the creation of test data generators that
  can drive property checks directly 

  from the API specification. Play-Swagger derives data generators and unit
  tests directly from your Swagger API specification.


  Property-based testing using generator-driven property checks is a cool way to
  test the validity of your application 

  according to the rules or properties that apply to your application.
  Properties, in this sense, are high-level 

  specifications that should always hold for a range of data values. The idea is
  to generate a range of data 

  values for your data types and let (also generated) tests assert that the
  properties of these data types hold. 

  A Swagger API definition contains formal type definitions _and_ constraints
  for all data values, and the Play-Swagger 

  plugin maps these types on managed Scala source code that represents the data
  types, so it is also possible to map 

  these API definitions on test data generators that provide a range of data
  values for these types. 

  The plugin does exactly that: It creates managed test data generators and unit
  tests that assert whether your 

  application still complies to your specification. It does so in a
  single-source-of-truth manner, 

  taking the Swagger API definition as the source.


  We employ the ScalaTest [property-based
  testing](http://www.scalatest.org/user_guide/property_based_testing) 

  functionality as the framework to generate the data values, and map the data
  types of our API definition on 

  the test data generators that are created by the plugin. ScalaTest provides 

  `org.scalacheck.Gen` and `org.scalacheck.Arbitrary` objects with utility
  methods that help generate a range of 

  (possibly arbitrary) data values for common Scala types and primitives. The
  Play-Swagger plugin uses these 

  methods to create test data generators specific for the data types of our API
  definition. When necessary, 

  it composes generators from primitive types into generators for complex types,
  so that you end up with a 

  set of generators that provide test data for your complete API.


  As an example, let's take the API definition for the simple pet store—trimmed
  down to the parts defining 

  parameter types, and (for brevity) omitting any non-data definitions and error
  definitions:


  ```yaml

  paths:
    /pets:
      get:
        parameters:
          - name: limit
            in: query
            required: false
            type: integer
            format: int32
        responses:
          default:
            description: error payload
      post:
        parameters:
          - name: pet
            in: body
            required: true
            schema:
              $ref: '#/definitions/newPet'
        responses:
          default:
            description: error payload
    /pets/{id}:
      get:
        parameters:
          - name: id
            in: path
            required: true
            type: integer
            format: int64
        responses:
          default:
            description: error payload
      delete:
        parameters:
          - name: id
            in: path
            required: true
            type: integer
            format: int64
        responses:
          default:
            description: error payload
  definitions:
    pet:
      required:
        - id
        - name
      properties:
        id:
          type: integer
          format: int64
        name:
          type: string
        tag:
          type: string
    newPet:
        required:
          - name
        properties:
          id:
            type: integer
            format: int64
          name:
            type: string
          tag:
            type: string
  ```


  The `get` method on path `/pets` takes an optional `limit` parameter of common
  type `integer`. 

  The `post` method takes a `newPet` body parameter comprising of the primitive
  attributes `id`, `name` and `tag`, 

  subsequently of common types `long` and `string` (twice). Of these, only the
  `name` attribute is mandatory. 

  The `get` method on the path `/pets/{id}` takes the path parameter `id` of
  common type `long` and returns 

  an array of `pet`s consisting of the same attributes and primitive types as a
  `newPet` - but this time 

  with both `name` and `id` being mandatory. This specification maps to the
  following managed Scala domain model code:



  ```scala

  package example


  package object yaml {

      import de.zalando.play.controllers.PlayPathBindables

      type PetsIdDeleteResponsesDefault = Null
      type NewPetTag = Option[String]
      type PetsIdDeleteId = Long
      type PetsGetLimit = Option[Int]
      type NewPetId = Option[Long]

      case class Pet(id: Long, name: String, tag: NewPetTag) 
      case class NewPet(name: String, id: NewPetId, tag: NewPetTag) 

      implicit val bindable_OptionIntQuery = PlayPathBindables.createOptionQueryBindable[Int]
  }

  ```


  We want to have test data generators that generate an arbitrary range of
  values for the model 

  code shown above - composed from primitive, and sometimes optional, data
  definitions. 

  The Play-Swagger plugin does this by generating two Scala objects: one for the
  Swagger API definition, 

  and one for the API path parts. Each object contains generator factory methods
  for the defined data types, 

  prefixed by `create`, which returns a generator function. A generator function
  takes a given integer count 

  and returns a generated amount of test data for the data type it was created
  for.


  Data types are composed from primitive types, Scala optional types, and
  possibly more complex types. 

  Test data values for the primitive types are generated arbitrarily, employing
  the ScalaCheck 

  `org.scalacheck.Arbitrary.arbitrary[T]` method (the type parameter, replaced
  with Scala's primitive type, 

  on which the Swagger common type is mapped).


  In the code shown below, starting with primitive leaf data values, the `pet`
  parameter's attribute `id` 

  of common type `long` is arbitrarily generated from a `scala.Long`.  Note that
  the `id` attribute is optional, 

  though, for the `newPet` definition. As with the generated model, we created a
  `NewPetIdGenerator` value that 

  takes an arbitrarily generated `scala.Long` id value and generates an option
  value from it, employing the 

  ScalaCheck `org.scalacheck.Gen.option[T]`.  This generator will generate test
  data values comprising of `None` 

  and `Some` arbitrarily id value. It's probably best to let the Scala generator
  code speak for itself. 

  Note how it composes according to the same structure as the Scala model code.


  ```scala

  package example.yaml


  import org.scalacheck.Gen

  import org.scalacheck.Arbitrary

  import play.api.libs.json.scalacheck.JsValueGenerators

  import Arbitrary._


  object Generators extends JsValueGenerators {

      def createNullGenerator = _generate(NullGenerator)
      def createNewPetTagGenerator = _generate(NewPetTagGenerator)
      def createLongGenerator = _generate(LongGenerator)
      def createPetsGetLimitGenerator = _generate(PetsGetLimitGenerator)
      def createNewPetIdGenerator = _generate(NewPetIdGenerator)

      def createPetGenerator = _generate(PetGenerator)
      def createNewPetGenerator = _generate(NewPetGenerator)

      def NullGenerator = arbitrary[Null]
      def NewPetTagGenerator = Gen.option(arbitrary[String])
      def LongGenerator = arbitrary[Long]
      def PetsGetLimitGenerator = Gen.option(arbitrary[Int])
      def NewPetIdGenerator = Gen.option(arbitrary[Long])

      def PetGenerator = for {
          id <- arbitrary[Long]
          name <- arbitrary[String]
          tag <- NewPetTagGenerator
      } yield Pet(id, name, tag)
      def NewPetGenerator = for {
          name <- arbitrary[String]
          id <- NewPetIdGenerator
          tag <- NewPetTagGenerator
      } yield NewPet(name, id, tag)

      def _generate[T](gen: Gen[T]) = (count: Int) => for (i <- 1 to count) yield gen.sample
  }

  ```


  A `PetGenerator` and `NewPetGenerator` are created and implemented by the
  plugin as a for comprehension 

  that generates data values for each attribute, yielding an instance of a test
  pet. Other generators follow 

  the same pattern but, if necessary, delegate to different child generators.
  From this we acquire a set of 

  test data generators to implement our property-based testing.


  Running the test is as simple as running a test set from sbt. Just type `test`
  from your `sbt` prompt.


  # Building a Play-Swagger Plugin


  To build a plugin, do the following:


  - Clone the repository to your local filesystem

  - Run ```sbt +publishLocal``` in the Play-Swagger directory. This will publish
  the plugin into your local ivy repository


  To use the plugin in a plain Play project:


  - Create a new Play-Swagger project using activator template, for example:
  ```activator new hello-world play-swagger-service```

  - Take a look at the `project/plugins.sbt` of the generated project and add
  required plugins and resolvers to the `project/plugins.sbt` of your Play
  project

  - Do the same for `build.sbt`

  - Put a Swagger specification with a ```.yaml``` or ```.json``` extension into
  the ```conf``` directory

  - Add a specification link (`->`) to the play's routes file



  ## Plugin Architecture


  Ths Play-Swagger plugin has a three-tier architecture:


  * specification - this tier is responsible for finding and parsing a
  specification and converting it into the raw AST format

  * normalisation - this tier performs a couple of optimisations on the AST
  including type deduplication, flattening and parameter dereferencing

  * generation - a final step including transformation of the AST into the
  source-code related data and generation of source code from it   


  The separation of the specification and generation tiers allows for plugging
  in different specification standards 

  and generating source code for different frameworks.



  ## Plugin Project Structure


  There are a couple of sub-projects:


  * `swagger-model` - A standalone Scala Swagger model and a Jackson parser for
  it. Can be used by another projects

  * `api` - This is the project that's automatically added to the runtime
  classpath of any projects that use this plugin.

  * `swagger-parser` - A converter of the Swagger model to the internal AST of
  the plugin

  * `api-first-core` - This is a core of the plugin with minimal functionality.
  It includes defining an AST structure and some transformations on AST.  

  * `play-scala-generator` - The standalone generator for transforming an AST
  into the skeleton of Play-Scala application. 

  * `plugin` - A coupble of sbt plugins, one for each tier:
      - `ApiFirstSwaggerParser` - a plugin wrapping Swagger parsing part 
      - `ApiFirstCore` - a wrapper for AST-related functionality
      - `ApiFirstPlayScalaCodeGenerator` - a wrapper for the Play-Scala generator

  Because of the modular plugin architecture, all modules must be enabled
  separatly in sbt's build.sbt. 

  It is also necessary to configure which parser(s) must be used by the plugin,
  like that: 


  ```scala

  lazy val root = (project in file(".")).enablePlugins(PlayScala, ApiFirstCore,
  ApiFirstPlayScalaCodeGenerator, ApiFirstSwaggerParser)


  apiFirstParsers := Seq(ApiFirstSwaggerParser.swaggerSpec2Ast.value).flatten

  ```


  Please take a look at activator template's configuration for complete example.



  ## Custom Templates For Code Generation


  The PlayScala generator supports custom templates. In order to override
  default template for some of the components,

  please provide your custom template named in accordance to the following list:

      * `play_scala_test.mustache` - for unit tests
      * `play_validation.mustache` - for validators 
      * `generators.mustache` - for test data generators
      * `model.mustache` - for model classes and query and path bindables
      * `play_scala_controller_base.mustache` - for play controller bases 
      * `play_scala_controller_security.mustache` - for security adapters used by controller bases
      * `play_scala_form_parser.mustache` - for form parsers used by the controller bases
      * `play_scala_controller.mustache` - for play controller skeletons supposed to be augmented by the programmer
      * `play_scala_response_writers.mustache` - for custom serializers to be augmented by the programmer
      * `play_scala_security_extractors.mustache` - for custom security extractors to be augmented by the programmer 


  Please be aware that generated artifacts need to preserve some specific shape
  in order to be compiled together without errors.


  The location where custom templates reside needs to be configured by
  overriding the plugin setting `playScalaCustomTemplateLocation`.


  For example following configuration will set this place to be `conf/templates`
  folder of the project:

  ```scala

  playScalaCustomTemplateLocation := Some(((resourceDirectory in Compile) /
  "templates").value)

  ```



  ## Plugin Developing


  sbt doesn't allow sub-projects to depend on each other as sbt plugins. To test
  an sbt plugin, you need a separate 

  project.  This project is `swagger-tester`.  To test your changes as you're
  developing the plugin, cd into this 

  directory, and run sbt. This project uses an sbt `ProjectRef` to the sbt
  plugin, which means you don't need to 

  `publishLocal` the plugin after each change. Just run `reload` in the sbt
  console, and it will pick up your changes.


  The play-swagger plugin provides a couple of commands useful for development: 


  * `apiFirstPrintDenotations` - outputs a common names of different parts of
  the AST as they are intended to be used in generated Scala code

  * `apiFirstPrintRawAstTypes` - outputs all type definitions as they read from
  the specification before type optimisations

  * `apiFirstPrintRawAstParameters` - outputs all parameters definitions before
  type optimisations

  * `apiFirstPrintFlatAstTypes` - outputs type definitions after type
  optimisations

  * `apiFirstPrintFlatAstParameters` - outputs parameter definitions after type
  optimisations



  ## Plugin Testing


  We're using the sbt scripted framework for testing. You can find the tests in
  `plugin/src/sbt-test`, and run them 

  by running `scripted` in the sbt console.



  ## Code quality


  There are some quality checks embedded into the build script:

  * the source code is (re)formatted using
  [scalariform](https://github.com/scala-ide/scalariform) each time it is
  compiled (currently deactivated).

  * [`scalastyle`](http://www.scalastyle.org) sbt command shall be used to
  perform code style checks before putting changes into the repository.

  * [`lint:compile`](https://github.com/HairyFotr/linter) sbt command shall be
  used to perform static code analysis before putting changes into the
  repository.

  * code coverage for api and compiler modules can be executed by issuing `sbt
  clean coverage test` command for these 

  projects. Coverage statistics can be generated using `coverageReport` sbt
  command.

  Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger)


  This package contains a golang implementation of Swagger 2.0 (aka [OpenAPI
  2.0](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md)):

  it knows how to serialize and deserialize swagger specifications.


  [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) is a simple yet powerful representation of your
  RESTful API.<br>

  **Swagger in a nutshell**

  >

  > With the largest ecosystem of API tooling on the planet, thousands of
  developers are supporting Swagger in almost every modern programming language
  and deployment environment.

  >

  > With a Swagger-enabled API, you get interactive documentation, client SDK
  generation and discoverability. We created Swagger to help fulfill the promise
  of APIs.

  >

  > Swagger helps companies like Apigee, Getty Images, Intuit, LivingSocial,
  McKesson, Microsoft, Morningstar, and PayPal build the best possible services
  with RESTful APIs. Now in version 2.0, Swagger is more enabling than ever. And
  it's 100% open source software.


  ##  Features

  `go-swagger` brings to the go community a complete suite of fully-featured,
  high-performance, API components to  work with a Swagger API: server, client
  and data model.


  * Generates a server from a swagger specification

  * Generates a client from a swagger specification

  * Supports most features offered by jsonschema and swagger, including
  polymorphism

  * Generates a swagger specification from annotated go code

  * Additional tools to work with a swagger spec

  * Great customization features, with vendor extensions and customizable
  templates


  Our focus with code generation is to produce idiomatic, fast go code, which
  plays nice with golint, go vet etc.


  ##  Project status

  `go-swagger` is now feature complete and has stabilized its API.


  Most features and building blocks are now in a stable state, with a rich set
  of CI tests.


  The go-openapi community actively continues bringing fixes and enhancements to
  this code base.


  There is still much room for improvement: contributors and PR's are welcome.
  You may also get in touch with maintainers on [our slack
  channel](https://slackin.goswagger.io).

  ## FAQ

  Q&A contributed by the community:


  <https://goswagger.io/faq/>


  ## How is this different from go generator in swagger-codegen?

  **tl;dr** The main difference at this moment is that this one actually
  works...


  The swagger-codegen project only generates a _workable_ go client and even
  there it will only support flat models.

  Further, the go server generated by swagger-codegen is mostly a stub.


  > **Motivation**

  > Why is this not done as a part of the swagger-codegen project? Because:

  >

  > * I don't really know java very well and so I'd be learning both java and
  the object model of the codegen which was in heavy flux as opposed to doing go
  and I really wanted to go experience of designing a large codebase with it.

  > * Go's super limited type system makes it so that it doesn't fit well in the
  model of swagger-codegen

  > * Go's idea of polymorphism doesn't reconcile very well with a solution
  designed for languages that actually have inheritance and so forth.

  > * For supporting types like `[][][]map[string][][]int64` I don't think it's
  possible with mustache

  >

  > I gravely underestimated the amount of work that would be involved in making
  something useful out of it.

  > My personal mission: I want the jvm to go away, it was great way back when
  now it's just silly (vm in container on vm in vm in container)

  ## Installing

  `go-swagger` is available as binary or docker releases as well as from source:
  [more details](https://goswagger.io/install.html).


  ## Use-cases

  The main package of the toolkit, go-swagger/go-swagger, provides command line
  tools to help working with swagger.


  The toolkit is highly customizable and allows endless possibilities to work
  with OpenAPI2.0 specifications.


  Beside the go-swagger CLI tool and generator, the [go-openapi
  packages](https://github.com/go-openapi) provide modular functionality to
  build custom solutions on top of OpenAPI.


  The CLI supports shell autocompletion utilities: see
  [here](https://goswagger.io/cli_helpers.html).


  ### Serve specification UI

  Most basic use-case: serve a UI for your spec:


  ```

  swagger serve
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/master/examples/v2.0/json/petstore-expanded.json

  ```


  ### Validate a specification

  To [validate](https://goswagger.io/usage/validate.html) a Swagger
  specification:


  ```

  swagger validate
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/master/examples/v2.0/json/petstore-expanded.json

  ```


  ### Generate an API server

  To generate a [server for a swagger
  spec](https://goswagger.io/generate/server.html) document:


  ```

  swagger generate server [-f ./swagger.json] -A [application-name [--principal
  [principal-name]]

  ```


  ### Generate an API client

  To generate a [client for a swagger
  spec](https://goswagger.io/generate/client.html) document:


  ```

  swagger generate client [-f ./swagger.json] -A [application-name [--principal
  [principal-name]]

  ```


  ### Generate a spec from source

  To generate a [swagger spec document for a go
  application](https://goswagger.io/generate/spec.html):


  ```

  swagger generate spec -o ./swagger.json

  ```


  ### Generate a data model

  To generate model structures and validators exposed by the API:


  ```

  swagger generate model --spec={spec}

  ```


  ### Transform specs


  There are [several commands](https://goswagger.io/use/transform.html) allowing
  you to transform your spec.


  Resolve and expand $ref's in your spec as inline definitions:

  ```

  swagger expand {spec}

  ```


  Flatten your spec: all external $ref's are imported into the main document and
  inline schemas reorganized as definitions.

  ```

  swagger flatten {spec}

  ```


  Merge specifications (composition):

  ```

  swagger mixin {spec1} {spec2}

  ```


  ### Compare specs


  The  diff command allows you to check backwards compatibility.

  Type ```swagger diff --help``` for info.


  ```

  swagger diff {spec1} {spec2}

  ```


  ## Try it


  Try `go-swagger` in a free online workspace using Gitpod:


  [![Open in
  Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger)


  ## Licensing


  The toolkit itself is licensed as Apache Software License 2.0. Just like
  swagger, this does not cover code generated by the toolkit. That code is
  entirely yours to license however you see fit.

  ## Note to users migrating from older releases


  ### Using 0.5.0


  Because 0.5.0 and master have diverged significantly, you should checkout the
  tag 0.5.0 for go-swagger when you use the currently released version.


  ### Migrating from 0.5.0 to 0.6.0


  You will have to rename some imports:


  ```

  github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/httpkit/validate to
  github.com/go-openapi/validate

  github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/httpkit to github.com/go-openapi/runtime

  github.com/naoina/denco to github.com/go-openapi/runtime/middleware/denco

  github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger to github.com/go-openapi

  ```


  ### Migrating from 0.12 to 0.13


  Spec flattening and $ref resolution brought breaking changes in model
  generation, since all complex things generate their own definitions.


  ### Migrating from 0.14 to 0.15


  Generated servers no more import the following package (replaced by go1.8
  native functionality):

  ```

  github.com/tylerb/graceful

  ```


  Spec flattening now defaults to minimal changes to models and should be
  workable for 0.12 users.


  Users who prefer to stick to 0.13 and 0.14 default flattening mode may now use
  the `--with-flatten=full` option.


  Note that the `--skip-flatten` option has been phased out and replaced by the
  more explicit `--with-expand` option.

  # hapi-openapi


  [![Build
  Status](https://travis-ci.org/krakenjs/hapi-openapi.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/krakenjs/hapi-openapi)

  [![NPM
  version](https://badge.fury.io/js/hapi-openapi.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/hapi-openapi)


  ### Note: this project was renamed from 'swaggerize-hapi' to 'hapi-openapi'.


  `hapi-openapi` is a design-driven approach to building RESTful services with
  [OpenAPI (Swagger)](http://openapis.org) and [Hapi](http://hapijs.com)
  (OpenAPI 3.0 support coming soon).


  `hapi-openapi` provides the following features:


  - API schema validation.

  - Routes based on the OpenAPI document.

  - API documentation route.

  - Input validation.


  ### Why "Design Driven"


  There are already a number of modules that help build RESTful APIs for node
  with OpenAPI. However,

  these modules tend to focus on building the documentation or specification as
  a side effect of writing

  the application business logic.


  `hapi-openapi` begins with the OpenAPI document first. This facilitates
  writing APIs that are easier to design, review, and test.


  At runtime, `hapi-openapi` uses the API specification to build routes from
  previously defined paths. This ensures that everything specified is what is
  implemented.


  ### Quick Start with a Generator


  This guide will let you go from an `api.json` to a service project in no time
  flat.


  First install `generator-swaggerize` (and `yo` if you haven't already):


  ```bash

  $ npm install -g yo

  $ npm install -g generator-swaggerize

  ```


  Now run the generator.


  ```bash

  $ mkdir petstore && cd $_

  $ yo swaggerize

  ```


  Follow the prompts (note: make sure to choose `hapi` as your framework
  choice).


  You now have a working api and can use something like
  [SwaggerHub](https://swaggerhub.com/?_ga=2.118604234.2143392684.1515431456-1673703125.1481054263)
  to explore it.


  ### Manual Usage


  ```javascript

  const Hapi = require('@hapi/hapi');


  const server = new Hapi.Server();


  await server.register({
      plugin: require('hapi-openapi'),
      options: {
          api: Path.join(__dirname, './config/pets.json'),
          handlers: Path.join(__dirname, './handlers')
      }
  });

  ```


  ### Hapi Plugin


  The plugin will be registered as `openapi` on `server.plugins` with the
  following exposed:


  - `getApi()` - the resolved Swagger document.

  - `setHost(host)` - a helper function for setting the `host` property on the
  `api`.


  ### Configuration Options


  - `api` - a path to a valid OpenAPI 2.0 document, or a valid document in the
  form of an object.

  - *deprecated* `docspath` - the path to expose api docs for swagger-ui, etc.
  Defaults to `/api-docs`.

  - `docs` - an object used to configure the api docs route.
      - `path` - the path to expose api docs for swagger-ui, etc. Defaults to `/api-docs`.
      - `auth` - options auth config for this route.
      - `stripExtensions` - strip vendor extensions from docs. Defaults to true.
      - `prefixBasePath` - prefix path of docs with he OpenAPI document's `basePath` value. Defaults to true.
  - `handlers` - either a string directory structure for route handlers, object,
  or not set if using `x-hapi-handler`.

  - `extensions` - an array of file extension types to use when scanning for
  handlers. Defaults to `['js']`.

  - `vhost` - *optional* domain string (see [hapi route
  options](http://hapijs.com/api#route-options)).

  - `cors` - *optional* cors setting (see [hapi route
  options](http://hapijs.com/api#route-options)).

  - `outputvalidation` - *optional* validate response data.


  ### Mount Path


  Api `path` values will be prefixed with the OpenAPI document's `basePath`
  value.  This behavior can be negated if you set the option
  `docs.prefixBasePath` to `false`.


  ### Handlers Directory


  The `options.handlers` option specifies a directory to scan for handlers.
  These handlers are bound to the api `paths` defined in the OpenAPI document.


  ```

  handlers
    |--foo
    |    |--bar.js
    |--foo.js
    |--baz.js
  ```


  Will route as:


  ```

  foo.js => /foo

  foo/bar.js => /foo/bar

  baz.js => /baz

  ```


  ### Path Parameters


  The file and directory names in the handlers directory can also represent path
  parameters.


  For example, to represent the path `/users/{id}`:


  ```shell

  handlers
    |--users
    |    |--{id}.js
  ```


  This works with directory names as well:


  ```shell

  handlers
    |--users
    |    |--{id}.js
    |    |--{id}
    |        |--foo.js
  ```


  To represent `/users/{id}/foo`.


  ### Handlers File


  Each provided javascript file should export an object containing functions
  with HTTP verbs as keys.


  Example:


  ```javascript

  module.exports = {
      get: function (req, h) { ... },
      put: function (req, h) { ... },
      ...
  }

  ```


  Optionally, `pre` handlers can be used by providing an array of handlers for a
  method:


  ```javascript

  module.exports = {
      get: [
          function p1(req, h) { ... },
          function handler(req, h) { ... }
      ],
  }

  ```


  ### Handlers Object


  The directory generation will yield this object, but it can be provided
  directly as `options.handlers`.


  Example:


  ```javascript

  {
      'foo': {
          'get': function (req, h) { ... },
          'bar': {
              'get': function (req, h) { ... },
              'post': function (req, h) { ... }
          }
      }
      ...
  }

  ```


  ### X-Hapi-Handler


  Alternatively the API document can set `x-hapi-handler` attribute on each
  defined `paths` element if `handlers` is not defined.


  Example:


  ```

  "/pets/{id}": {
      "x-hapi-handler": "./routes/pets-by-id.js",
      .
      .
      .
  ```


  This will construct a `handlers` object from the given `x-hapi-handler` files.


  ### X-Hapi-Options


  There is now support at the operations level for `x-hapi-options` which
  represent individual [Hapi Route
  Optijons](https://github.com/hapijs/hapi/blob/master/API.md#route-options).


  This support is limited to configuration supported by the JSON file type.


  Example:


  ```

  "/internal": {
    "post": {
      "x-hapi-options": {
        "isInternal": true
      }
      .
      .
      .
  ```


  ### Authentication


  Support for OpenAPI [security
  schemes](http://swagger.io/specification/#securitySchemeObject) requires that
  relevant authentication scheme and strategy are registered before the
  hapi-openapi plugin. See the [hapi docs](http://hapijs.com/tutorials/auth) for
  information about authentication schemes and strategies.


  The name of the hapi authentication strategy is expected to match the name
  field of the OpenAPI [security requirement
  object](http://swagger.io/specification/#securityRequirementObject).


  Example:


  ```yaml

  securityDefinitions:
    api_key:
      type: apiKey
      name: Authorization
      in: header
  paths:
    '/users/':
      get:
        security:
          - api_key: []
  ```


  ```javascript

  const server = new Hapi.Server();


  await server.register({ plugin: AuthTokenScheme });


  server.auth.strategy('api_key', 'auth-token-scheme', {
      validateFunc: async function (token) {
        // Implement validation here, return { credentials, artifacts }.
      }
  });


  await server.register({
      plugin: require('hapi-openapi'),
      options: {
          api: require('./config/pets.json'),
          handlers: Path.join(__dirname, './handlers')
      }
  });

  ```


  ### X-Hapi-Auth


  Alternatively it may be easier to automatically register a plugin to handle
  registering the necessary schemes and strategies.


  **x-hapi-auth-schemes**


  The root document can contain an `x-hapi-auth-schemes` object specifying
  different plugins responsible for registering auth schemes.


  Example:


  ```

  "x-hapi-auth-schemes": {
      "apiKey": "../lib/xauth-scheme.js"
  }

  ```


  This plugin will be passed the following options:


  - `name` - the auth scheme name, in this example `apiKey`.


  **x-hapi-auth-strategy**


  The `securityDefinitions` entries can contain an `x-hapi-auth-strategy`
  attribute pointing to a plugin responsible for registering auth strategies.


  Example:


  ```

  "securityDefinitions": {
    "api_key": {
      "x-hapi-auth-strategy": "../lib/xauth-strategy.js",
      "type": "apiKey",
      "name": "authorization",
      "in": "header"
    }
  }

  ```


  The plugin will be passed the following options:


  - `name` - the `securityDefinitions` entry's key. In this example, `api_key`.
  This is typically used as the strategy name.

  - `scheme` - the `securityDefinitions` `type`. In this example, `apiKey`. This
  should match a `x-hapi-auth-scheme` name.

  - `where` - `securityDefinitions` entry `in` attribute. This is search for the
  `lookup` value; in this example `header`.

  - `lookup` - `securityDefinitions` entry `name` attribute. Used as the name to
  look up against `where`.


  The way you can make these play together is that for every `type`, a scheme
  exists that delegates some lookup or evaluation to the appropriate strategy.


  Example:


  ```javascript

  //xauth-scheme.js


  const register = function (server, { name  }) {
      server.auth.scheme(name /*apiKey*/, (server, /* options received from the strategy */ { validate }) => {
          return {
              authenticate: async function (request, h) {
                  return h.authenticated(await validate(request));
              }
          };
      });
  };


  module.exports = { register, name: 'x-hapi-auth-scheme' };

  ```


  and


  ```javascript

  //xauth-strategy.js


  const Boom = require('@hapi/boom');


  const register = function (server, { name, scheme, where, lookup }) {
      server.auth.strategy(name, /* the scheme to use this strategy with */ scheme, {
          //Define a validate function for the scheme above to receive
          validate: async function (request) {
              const token = request.headers[lookup];

              //Some arbitrary example
              if (token === '12345') {
                  return { credentials: { scope: ['read'] }, artifacts: { token } };
              }

              throw Boom.unauthorized();
          }
      });
  };


  module.exports = { register, name: 'x-hapi-auth-strategy' };

  ```

  A python client for [Swagger](https://helloreverb.com/developers/swagger)
  enabled REST API. It wouldn't be easier to

  try Swagger REST API by [Swagger-UI](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-ui).
  However, when it's time to **unittest**

  your API, the first option you find would be
  [Swagger-codegen](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-codegen), but the better
  option is us.


  This project is developed after
  [swagger-py](https://github.com/digium/swagger-py), which is a nicely
  implemented one, and inspired many aspects of this project. Another project is
  [flex](https://github.com/pipermerriam/flex), which focuses on parameter
  validation, try it if you can handle other parts by yourselves. For other
  projects related to Swagger tools in python, check
  [here](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec#python).


  **pyswagger** is much easier to use (compared to swagger-codegen, you don't
  need to prepare a scala environment) and tries hard to **fully supports**
  [Swagger Spec](https://helloreverb.com/developers/swagger) in all aspects.

  ---------


  ## Features

  - convert Swagger Document from older version to newer one. (ex. convert from
  1.2 to 2.0)

  - support Swagger **1.2**, **2.0** on python ~~2.6~~, **2.7**, **3.3**,
  **3.5**, **3.6**

  - support YAML via [Pretty-YAML](https://github.com/mk-fg/pretty-yaml)

  - support $ref to **External Document**, multiple swagger.json will be
  organized into a group of App. And external document with self-describing
  resource is also supported (refer to
  [issue](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/issues/219)).

  - type safe, input/output are converted to python types according to [Data
  Type](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/1.2.md#43-data-types)
  described in Swagger. You don't need to touch any json schema when using
  pyswagger. Limitations like **minimum/maximum** or **enum** are also checked.

  ## Quick Start


  Before running this script, please make sure
  [requests](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests) is installed on your
  environment.


  ```python

  from pyswagger import App, Security

  from pyswagger.contrib.client.requests import Client

  from pyswagger.utils import jp_compose


  # load Swagger resource file into App object

  app = App._create_('http://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json')


  auth = Security(app)

  auth.update_with('api_key', '12312312312312312313q') # api key

  auth.update_with('petstore_auth', '12334546556521123fsfss') # oauth2


  # init swagger client

  client = Client(auth)


  # a dict is enough for representing a Model in Swagger

  pet_Tom=dict(id=1, name='Tom', photoUrls=['http://test']) 

  # a request to create a new pet

  client.request(app.op['addPet'](body=pet_Tom))


  # - access an Operation object via App.op when operationId is defined

  # - a request to get the pet back

  req, resp = app.op['getPetById'](petId=1)

  # prefer json as response

  req.produce('application/json')

  pet = client.request((req, resp)).data

  assert pet.id == 1

  assert pet.name == 'Tom'


  # new ways to get Operation object corresponding to 'getPetById'.

  # 'jp_compose' stands for JSON-Pointer composition

  req, resp = app.resolve(jp_compose('/pet/{petId}',
  base='#/paths')).get(petId=1)

  req.produce('application/json')

  pet = client.request((req, resp)).data

  assert pet.id == 1

  ```

  ## Installation

  We support pip installtion.

  ```bash

  pip install pyswagger

  ```


  Additional dependencies must be prepared before firing a request. If you are
  going to access a remote/local web server, you must install
  [requests](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests) first.

  ```bash

  pip install requests

  ```


  If you want to test a local tornado server, please make sure tornado is ready
  on your environment

  ``` bash

  pip install tornado

  ```


  We also provide native client for flask app, but to use it, flask is also
  required

  ``` bash

  pip install flask

  ```

  == Overview



  NOTE: Dear community,

  unfortunately I can't maintain Swagger2Markup alone anymore. There are many
  interesting new topics:

  1) Swagger v3 support

  2) Fixing bugs

  2) Merge Swagger2Markup repositories and create a new multi-module repository.

  Any help is welcome.

  Kind regards,

  Robert



  The primary goal of this project is to *simplify the generation of an
  up-to-date RESTful API documentation by combining documentation that's been
  hand-written with auto-generated API documentation* produced by
  https://github.com/swagger-api[Swagger]. The result is intended to be an
  *up-to-date, easy-to-read, on- and offline user guide*, comparable to
  https://developer.github.com/v3/[GitHub's API documentation]. The output of
  Swagger2Markup can be used as an alternative to
  https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui[swagger-ui] and can be served as
  static content.

  NOTE: The Swagger Specification has been donated to to the
  https://openapis.org/[Open API Initiative (OAI)] and has been renamed to the
  https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification[OpenAPI Specification].


  Swagger2Markup converts a Swagger JSON or YAML file into several *AsciiDoc* or
  *GitHub Flavored Markdown* documents which can be combined with hand-written
  documentation. The Swagger source file can be located locally or remotely via
  HTTP. Swagger2Markup supports the Swagger 1.2 and 2.0 specification.
  Internally it uses the _official_
  https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-parser[swagger-parser] and my
  https://github.com/RobWin/markup-document-builder[markup-document-builder].


  You can use Swagger2Markup to convert your contract-first Swagger YAML file
  into a human-readable format and combine it with hand-written documentation.
  As an alternative, you can choose the code-first approach and use
  Swagger2Markup together with
  https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki/Swagger-Core-JAX-RS-Project-Setup-1.5.X[Swagger
  JAX-RS], https://github.com/springfox/springfox[springfox] or
  https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-restdocs[spring-restdocs]. If you
  are Gradle or Maven user, you can also use the
  https://github.com/RobWin/swagger2markup-gradle-plugin[Swagger2Markup Gradle
  Plugin] or
  https://github.com/redowl/swagger2markup-maven-plugin[Swagger2markup Maven
  Plugin].


  http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/[AsciiDoc] is preferable to
  Markdown as it has more features. AsciiDoc is a text document format for
  writing documentation, articles, books, ebooks, slideshows, web pages and
  blogs. AsciiDoc files can be converted to *HTML*, *PDF* and *EPUB*. AsciiDoc
  is much better suited for describing public APIs than *JavaDoc* or
  *Annotations*.


  You can generate your HTML5, PDF and EPUB documentation via
  https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctorj[asciidoctorj] or even better via
  the
  https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-gradle-plugin[asciidoctor-gradle-plugin]
  or
  https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-maven-plugin[asciidoctor-maven-plugin].


  The project requires at least JDK 8.

  # OpenAPI-CodeGen


  [![Build
  status](https://travis-ci.org/Mermade/openapi-codegen.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Mermade/openapi-codegen)


  Node.js-based codegen for OpenAPI documents. This project was initially a
  24-hour hackathon. The local model adaptor code is entirely original and has
  been reverse-engineered from the existing documentation and template usage.


  **Work in progress**


  Supports OpenAPI 3.0.x natively, and Swagger/OpenAPI 1.2 and 2.0 by internal
  conversion. Node.js LTS versions are supported.


  ## Usage


  ### Installing


  `npm i -g openapi-codegen`


  or


  * clone the repository, and

  * `npm i`


  or


  `npx -p openapi-codegen cg ...`


  ### CLI


  ```

  cg [options] {[path]configName} {openapi-definition}


  Options:
    --help           Show help                                           [boolean]
    --version        Show version number                                 [boolean]
    --filter         Filter term to use with --list                       [string]
    --list           List available templates for provider (og or sc)     [string]
    -d, --debug      Turn on debugging information in the model          [boolean]
    -f, --flat       Do not include config-name in output directory structure
                                                                         [boolean]
    -l, --lint       Lint input definition                               [boolean]
    -o, --output     Specify output directory         [string] [default: "./out/"]
    -s, --stools     Use swagger-tools to validate OpenAPI 2.0 definitions
                                                                         [boolean]
    -t, --templates  Specify templates directory                          [string]
    -v, --verbose    Increase verbosity                                  [boolean]
    -z, --zip        Create a .zip file instead of individual files      [boolean]
  ```


  e.g.


  ```

  node cg --verbose nodejs defs/generator.yaml

  ```


  In this case, the generated code will be written to the `.out/nodejs`
  directory.


  You can also load the OpenAPI definition from a URL.


  ### API


  ```javascript

  const renderer = require('openapi-codegen');

  // load a config and a definition

  renderer.main(definition,config,configName);

  ```


  ## Templates


  The local templates were taken directly from `swagger-codegen`. This project
  is also licensed under [Apache-2.0](LICENSE) for this reason. Generated code
  is explicitly covered by the [Unlicense](templates/_common/UNLICENSE). Code to
  downconvert OpenAPI 3.0 definitions is taken from
  [Angular-Swagger-UI](https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/angular-swagger-ui)
  and is MIT licensed.


  You can also use the latest online templates from two providers: `og`
  ([openapi-generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator)) and
  `sc` ([swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen)). The
  `--list` and `--filter` options allow you to see which templates are
  available. Note that using the online templates involves sending your API
  definition to a remote server.


  ### Contributors


  See [here](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen#template-creator)
  for a partial list of template contributors.


  ### Status of the template configurations


  The local templates with a status have a working (if not necessarily tested)
  configuration in the **configs** directory. Contributions are welcomed from
  the community of new and updated configurations and template updates.

  ## Usage


  ### CLI Tool

      $ vendor/bin/php-openapi help
      PHP OpenAPI 3 tool
      ------------------
      by Carsten Brandt <mail@cebe.cc>

      Usage:
        php-openapi <command> [<options>] [input.yml|input.json] [output.yml|output.json]

        The following commands are available:

          validate   Validate the API Description in the specified input file against the OpenAPI v3.0 schema.
                     Note: the validation is performed in two steps. The results are composed of
                      (1) structural errors found while reading the API Description file, and
                      (2) violations of the OpenAPI v3.0 schema.

                     If no input file is specified input will be read from STDIN.
                     The tool will try to auto-detect the content type of the input, but may fail
                     to do so. You may specify --read-yaml or --read-json to force the file type.

                     Exits with code 2 on validation errors, 1 on other errors and 0 on success.

          convert    Convert a JSON or YAML input file to JSON or YAML output file.

                     If no input file is specified input will be read from STDIN.
                     If no output file is specified output will be written to STDOUT.
                     The tool will try to auto-detect the content type of the input and output file, but may fail
                     to do so. You may specify --read-yaml or --read-json to force the input file type.
                     and --write-yaml or --write-json to force the output file type.

                     By default all references are resolved (replaced with the object referred to). You can control
                     handling of references with the following arguments:

                     --resolve-none      Do not resolve references.
                     --resolve-external  Only resolve references that point to external files.
                                         This process is often referred to as "inlining".
                     --resolve-all       Resolve all references (default).
                                         Recursive pointers will stay references.

          inline     Convert a JSON or YAML input file to JSON or YAML output file and
                     resolve all external references. The output will be a single API Description file.
                     This is a shortcut for calling convert --resolve-external.

          help       Shows this usage information.

        Options:

          --read-json   force reading input as JSON. Auto-detect if not specified.
          --read-yaml   force reading input as YAML. Auto-detect if not specified.
          --write-json  force writing output as JSON. Auto-detect if not specified.
          --write-yaml  force writing output as YAML. Auto-detect if not specified.
          -s, --silent  silent mode. Will hide all success/information messages and only print errors.


  ### Reading API Description Files


  Read OpenAPI Description from JSON file:


  ```php

  use cebe\openapi\Reader;


  // realpath is needed for resolving references with relative Paths or URLs

  $openapi = Reader::readFromJsonFile(realpath('openapi.json'));

  ```


  Read OpenAPI Description from YAML:


  ```php

  use cebe\openapi\Reader;


  // realpath is needed for resolving references with relative Paths or URLs

  $openapi = Reader::readFromYamlFile(realpath('openapi.yaml'));

  // you may also specify the URL to your API Description file

  $openapi =
  Reader::readFromYamlFile('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/3.0.2/examples/v3.0/petstore-expanded.yaml');

  ```


  Access API Description data:


  ```php

  echo $openapi->openapi; // openAPI version, e.g. 3.0.0

  echo $openapi->info->title; // API title

  foreach($openapi->paths as $path => $definition) {
      // iterate path definitions
  }

  ```


  Object properties are exactly like in the [OpenAPI
  Specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/3.0.2/versions/3.0.2.md#openapi-specification).

  You may also access additional properties added by [specification
  extensions](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/3.0.2/versions/3.0.2.md#specificationExtensions).


  ### Writing API Description Files


  ```php

  use cebe\openapi\spec\OpenApi;

  use cebe\openapi\spec\PathItem;


  // create base API Description

  $openapi = new OpenApi([
      'openapi' => '3.0.2',
      'info' => [
          'title' => 'Test API',
          'version' => '1.0.0',
      ],
      'paths' => [],
  ]);

  // manipulate description as needed

  $openapi->paths['/test'] = new PathItem([
      'description' => 'something'
  ]);

  // ...


  $json = \cebe\openapi\Writer::writeToJson($openapi);

  ```


  results in the following JSON data:


  ```json

  {
      "openapi": "3.0.0",
      "info": {
          "title": "Test API",
          "version": "1.0.0"
      },
      "paths": {
          "/test": {
              "description": "something"
          }
      }
  }

  ```


  ### Writing API Description Files using prepared Objects


  Since version 1.2.0, the above example can also be written like this (passing
  objects instead of arrays):


  ```php

  use cebe\openapi\spec\OpenApi;

  use cebe\openapi\spec\PathItem;

  use cebe\openapi\spec\Info;



  // create base API Description

  $openapi = new OpenApi([
      'openapi' => '3.0.2',
      'info' => new Info([
          'title' => 'Test API',
          'version' => '1.0.0',
      ]),
      'paths' => [
          '/test' => new PathItem([
              'description' => 'something'
          ]),
      ],
  ]);

  $json = \cebe\openapi\Writer::writeToJson($openapi);

  ```


  ### Reading API Description Files and Resolving References


  In the above we have passed the raw JSON or YAML data to the Reader. In order
  to be able to resolve

  references to structures in external files, we must provide the full context.


  ```php

  use cebe\openapi\Reader;

  use cebe\openapi\spec\OpenAPI;

  use cebe\openapi\ReferenceContext;


  // there are two different modes for resolving references:

  // ALL: resolve all references, which will result in a large description with
  a lot of repetition

  // but no references (except if there are recursive references, these will
  stop at some level)

  $mode = ReferenceContext::RESOLVE_MODE_ALL;

  // INLINE: only references to external files are resolved, references to
  places in the current file

  // are still Reference objects.

  $mode = ReferenceContext::RESOLVE_MODE_INLINE;


  // an absolute URL or file path is needed to allow resolving external
  references

  $openapi =
  Reader::readFromJsonFile('https://www.example.com/api/openapi.json',
  OpenAPI::class, $mode);

  $openapi =
  Reader::readFromYamlFile('https://www.example.com/api/openapi.yaml',
  OpenAPI::class, $mode);

  ```


  If data has been loaded in a different way you can manually resolve references
  like this by giving a context:


  ```php

  $openapi->resolveReferences(
      new \cebe\openapi\ReferenceContext($openapi, 'https://www.example.com/api/openapi.yaml')
  );

  ```


  ### Validation


  The library provides simple validation operations, that check basic OpenAPI
  spec requirements.

  This is the same as "structural errors found while reading the API Description
  file" from the CLI tool.

  This validation does not include checking against the OpenAPI v3.0 JSON
  schema, this is only implemented in the CLI.


  ```

  // return `true` in case no errors have been found, `false` in case of errors.

  $specValid = $openapi->validate();

  // after validation getErrors() can be used to retrieve the list of errors
  found.

  $errors = $openapi->getErrors();

  ```


  > **Note:** Validation is done on a very basic level and is not complete. So a
  failing validation will show some errors,

  > but the list of errors given may not be complete. Also a passing validation
  does not necessarily indicate a completely

  > valid spec.

  ## Swurg is a Burp Suite extension designed for OpenAPI testing.

  > The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) defines a standard, programming
  language-agnostic interface description for REST APIs, which allows both
  humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of a service
  without requiring access to source code, additional documentation, or
  inspection of network traffic. When properly defined via OpenAPI, a consumer
  can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of
  implementation logic. Similar to what interface descriptions have done for
  lower-level programming, the OpenAPI Specification removes guesswork in
  calling a service. 

  > 

  > Use cases for machine-readable API definition documents include, but are not
  limited to: interactive documentation; code generation for documentation,
  clients, and servers; and automation of test cases. OpenAPI documents describe
  an API's services and are represented in either YAML or JSON formats. These
  documents may either be produced and served statically or be generated
  dynamically from an application.

  > 

  > \- [OpenAPI Initiative](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification)


  Performing security assessment of OpenAPI-based APIs can be a tedious task due
  to Burp Suite (industry standard) lacking native OpenAPI parsing capabilities.
  A solution to this situation, is to use third-party tools (e.g. `SOAP-UI`) or
  to implement custom scripts (often on a per engagement basis) to handle the
  parsing of OpenAPI documents and integrate/chain the results to Burp Suite to
  use its first class scanning capabilities.


  Swurg is an OpenAPI parser that aims to streamline this entire process by
  allowing security professionals to use Burp Suite as a standalone tool for
  security assessment of OpenAPI-based APIs.


  ## Supported Features

  * Parse OpenAPI documents, formerly known as the `Swagger specification`,
  fully compliant with OpenAPI 2.0/3.0 Specifications (OAS). Supports both JSON
  and YAML formats.

  * OpenAPI documents can be parsed either from a supplied file or URL. The
  extension can fetch OpenAPI documents directly from a URL using the `Send to
  Swagger Parser` feature under the `Target -> Site map` context menu.

  * Requests can be sent to the `Comparer, Intruder, Repeater, Scanner and Site
  map` Burp tools.


  ## Installation

  ### Compilation 

  #### Windows & Linux

  1. Install gradle (<https://gradle.org/>)

  2. Download the repository.

  ```console

  $ git clone https://github.com/AresS31/swurg

  $ cd .\swurg\

  ```

  3. Create the swurg jarfile:

  ```console

  $ gradle fatJar

  ```


  ### Burp Suite settings

  In Burp Suite, under the `Extender/Options` tab, click on the `Add` button and
  load the `swurg-all` jarfile. 


  ## Possible Improvements

  - [ ] Beautify the graphical user interface.

  - [ ] Enable cells editing to change API calls directly from the GUI.

  - [x] Further optimise the source code.

  - [ ] Implement support for authenticated testing (via user-supplied
  API-keys).

  - [ ] Improve the Param column by adding the type of parameters (e.g. inquery,
  inbody, etc.).

  - [ ] Increase the extension verbosity (via the bottom panel).


  ## Dependencies

  ### Third-party libraries

  #### Swagger Parser:

  The [Swagger
  Parser](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.swagger.parser.v3/swagger-parser)
  library is required and automatically imported in this project.


  ## Project information

  In July 2016, after posting a request for improvement on the [PortSwigger
  support
  forum](https://support.portswigger.net/customer/portal/questions/16358278-swagger-parser-and-wsdler-improvement),
  I decided to take the initiative and to implement a solution myself.


  The extension is still in development, feedback, comments and contributions
  are therefore much appreciated.

  A simple, quick, cross-platform API mock server that returns examples
  specified in an API description document. Features include:


  - OpenAPI 3.x support
    - Uses operation `examples` or generates examples from `schema`
  - Load from a URL or local file (auto reload with `--watch`)

  - CORS headers enabled by default

  - Accept header content negotiation
    - Example: `Accept: application/*`
  - Prefer header to select response to test specific cases
    - Example: `Prefer: status=409`
  - Server validation (enabled with `--validate-server`)
    - Validates scheme, hostname/port, and base path
    - Supports `localhost` out of the box
    - Use the `--add-server` flag, in conjunction with `--validate-server`, to dynamically include more servers in the validation logic
  - Request parameter & body validation (enabled with `--validate-request`)

  - Configuration via:
    - Files (`/etc/apisprout/config.json|yaml`)
    - Environment (prefixed with `SPROUT_`, e.g. `SPROUT_VALIDATE_SERVER`)
    - Commandline flags

  Usage is simple:


  ```sh

  # Load from a local file

  apisprout my-api.yaml


  # Validate server name and use base path

  apisprout --validate-server my-api.yaml


  # Dynamically Include a new server / path in the validation

  apisprout --add-server http://localhost:8080/mock --validate-server
  my-api.yaml


  # Load from a URL

  apisprout
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/master/examples/v3.0/api-with-examples.yaml

  ```


  ## Docker Image


  A hosted [API Sprout Docker
  image](https://hub.docker.com/r/danielgtaylor/apisprout/) is provided that
  makes it easy to deploy mock servers or run locally. For example:


  ```sh

  docker pull danielgtaylor/apisprout

  docker run -p 8000:8000 danielgtaylor/apisprout http://example.com/my-api.yaml

  ```


  Configuration can be passed via environment variables, e.g. setting
  `SPROUT_VALIDATE_REQUEST=1`, or by passing commandline flags. It is also
  possible to use a local API description file via [Docker
  Volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/):


  ```

  # Remember to put the full path to local archive YAML in -v

  docker run -p 8000:8000 -v $FULLPATH/localfile.yaml:/api.yaml
  danielgtaylor/apisprout /api.yaml

  ```


  ## Installation


  Download the appropriate binary from the
  [releases](https://github.com/danielgtaylor/apisprout/releases) page.


  Alternatively, you can use `go get`:


  ```sh

  go get github.com/danielgtaylor/apisprout

  ```


  ## Extra Features


  ### Remote Reload


  If your API spec is loaded from a remote URL, you can live-reload it by
  hitting the `/__reload` endpoint.


  ### Health Check


  A simple endpoint which returns status code `200` is available at `/__health`.
  This endpoint successfully returns `200` even if `--validate-server` is turned
  on, and the endpoint is being accessed from a non-validated host.


  ## Contributing


  Contributions are very welcome. Please open a tracking issue or pull request
  and we can work to get things merged in.


  ## Release Process


  The following describes the steps to make a new release of API Sprout.


  1. Merge open PRs you want to release.

  1. Select a new semver version number (major/minor/patch depending on
  changes).

  1. Update `CHANGELOG.md` to describe changes.

  <h1 align="center">OpenAPI 3 Generator</h1>

  <p align="center">
    Use your API OpenAPI 3 definition to generate code, documentation, and literally anything you need.
  </p>


  ## Install


  To use it from the CLI:


  ```bash

  npm install -g openapi3-generator

  ```


  ## Requirements


  * Node.js v7.6+


  ## Usage


  ### From the command-line interface (CLI)


  ```bash
    Usage: og [options] <openapiFileOrURL> <template>


    Options:

      -V, --version                  output the version number
      -o, --output <outputDir>       directory where to put the generated files (defaults to current directory)
      -t, --templates <templateDir>  directory where templates are located (defaults to internal templates directory)
      -b, --basedir <baseDir>        directory to use as the base when resolving local file references (defaults to OpenAPI file directory)
      -h, --help                     output usage information
  ```


  #### Examples


  The shortest possible syntax:

  ```bash

  og openapi.yaml markdown

  ```


  Specify where to put the generated code:

  ```bash

  og -o ./my-docs openapi.yaml markdown

  ```


  ## Templates


  ### Creating your own templates

  Templates are the sources where the result will be generated from. There are
  already some templates

  you can use to generate code and documentation.


  The files in your template can be of the following types:

  1. Static: This kind of files will be simply copied to the output directory.

  2. Templates: This kind of files will be compiled using
  [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/), and copied to the output directory.

  3. Path templates: This kind of files will be compiled using
  [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/), but it will generate one file per
  OpenAPI path.


  Assuming we have the following OpenAPI Spec:

  ```yaml

  openapi: "3.0.0"

  info:
    version: 1.0.0
    title: OpenAPI Petstore
    license:
      name: MIT
  servers:
    - url: http://petstore.openapi.io/v1
  paths:
    /pet:
      get:...
      post:...
    /pet/{petId}:
      get:...
    /user/login:
      post:...
    /user/{username}:
      get:...
      put:...
      delete:...
  ...

  ```

  And some template files like this:

  ```

  |- index.js            // This file contains static code, e.g. starting a
  webserver and including ./api/index.js

  |+ api/
   |- index.js.hbs       // This is a static template, it contains placeholders that will be filled in, e.g. includes for each file in routes
   |+ routes/
    |- $$path$$.route.js.hbs      // This file will be generated for each operation and contains skeleton code for each method for an operation.
    |+ $$path$$/                  // This folder will also be generated for each operation.
      |- route.js.hbs             // This is another example of an operation file.
  ```

  The first important thing to notice here is the variable notation in
  `$$path$$.route.js.hbs`. It will be replaced by the name of the path.


  This example also shows `$$path$$` used in a folder name - the generated
  folder names here will replace $$path$$ with

  the name of the path (in kebab-case).


  In this example the generated directory structure will be like this:

  ```

  |- index.js            // This file still contains static code like before.

  |+ api/
   |- index.js           // This file will now e.g. have included the two files in routes.
   |+ routes/
    |- pet.route.js      // This file contains the code for methods on pets.
    |                    // (e.g. getPet, postPet, getPetByPetId).
    |- user.route.js     // This file will contain the code for methods on users.
    |                    // (e.g. postUserLogin, getUserByUsername, putUserByUsername, deleteUserByUsername).
    |+ pet/
     | - route.js        // this file also contains the code for methods on pets.
    |+ user/
     | - route.js        // this file also contains the code for methods on users.
  ```


  ### Template file extensions

  You can (optionally) name your template files with `.hbs` extensions, which
  will be removed when writing the generated

  file. e.g. `index.js.hbs` writes `index.js`. `index.js` would also write to
  `index.js`, if you prefer to omit the hbs

  extension.


  The only case where the `.hbs` extension isn't optional would be if you are
  writing handlebars templates with the

  templates. In that case the the template would need the extension `.hbs.hbs`.
  `usertpl.hbs.hbs` writes `usertpl.hbs`

  (but `usertpl.hbs` as a source would write `usertpl` with no extension).


  ### Template file content

  The generator passes the OpenAPI spec to template files, so all information
  should be available there.

  In addition to that, the code generator adds a bit [more
  data](#data-passed-to-handlebars-templates) that can be helpful.


  #### Examples:

  ##### Dynamically require files in JavaScript

  ```mustache

  {{#each @root.openapi.endpoints}}

  const {{.}} = require('./routes/{{.}}.route.js')

  {{/each}}

  ```

  will produce (using the OAS Spec example from above):

  ```js

  const pet = require('./routes/pet.route.js')

  const user = require('./routes/user.route.js')

  ```


  ### Data passed to Handlebars templates

  | Param | Type | Description |

  | --- | --- | --- |

  |openapi|object|The OpenAPI spec.|

  |openapi.endpoints| object | All first level endpoints (e.g  `pet` and `user`)
  |


  ### Custom handlebars helpers

  If your template needs Handlebars helpers, you can define them in a directory
  called `.helpers` inside your template.


  Check out some examples in the [markdown](./templates/markdown/.helpers)
  template.


  ### Using handlebars partials

  If you want to use partials in your template, define them in a directory
  called `.partials` inside your template.


  Check out some examples in the [markdown](./templates/markdown/.partials)
  template.


  > The name of the partial will be obtained from the file name, converted to
  camel case. So, for instance, if the file name is `my-partial.js`, you can use
  the partial with `{{> myPartial}}`.

  # Convert OData to OpenAPI.NET [Preview]


  [**Disclaimer:This library is in a preview state. Feedback and contribution is
  welcome!**]


  ## Introduction


  The **Microsoft.OpenAPI.OData.Reader** library helps represent an OData
  service metadata as an OpenApi description. It converts
  [OData](http://www.odata.org)
  [CSDL](http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata-csdl-xml/v4.01/odata-csdl-xml-v4.01.html),
  the XML representation of the Entity Data Model (EDM) describing an OData
  service into [Open API](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) based on
  [OpenAPI.NET](http://aka.ms/openapi) object model.


  The conversion is based on the mapping doc from [OASIS OData OpenAPI
  v1.0](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/document.php?document_id=61852&wg_abbrev=odata)
  and uses the following :


  1. [Capabilities vocabulary
  annotation](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/odata-vocabularies/blob/master/vocabularies/Org.OData.Capabilities.V1.xml)

  2. [Authorization vocabulary
  annotation](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/odata-vocabularies/blob/master/vocabularies/Org.OData.Authorization.V1.xml)

  3. [Core vocabulary
  annotation](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/odata-vocabularies/blob/master/vocabularies/Org.OData.Core.V1.xml)

  4. Navigation property path

  5. Edm operation and operation import path


  ## Overview


  The image below is generic overview of how this library can convert the EDM
  model to an [OpenAPI.NET
  document](https://github.com/Microsoft/OpenAPI.NET/blob/master/src/Microsoft.OpenApi/Models/OpenApiDocument.cs)
  object.


  ![Convert OData CSDL to OpenAPI](docs/images/odata-2-openapi.png "Map ///
  OData CSDL --> OpenAPI.NET")


  For more information on the CSDL and Entity Data model, please refer to
  [http://www.odata.org/documentation](http://www.odata.org/documentation).

  For more information about the Open API object of model, please refer to
  [http://github.com/microsoft/OpenAPI.NET](http://github.com/microsoft/OpenAPI.NET)


  ## Sample code


  The following sample code illustrates the use of the library


  ```csharp

  public static void GenerateOpenApiDescription()

  {
      IEdmModel model = GetEdmModel();
      OpenApiDocument document = model.ConvertToOpenApi();
      var outputJSON = document.SerializeAsJson(OpenApiSpecVersion.OpenApi3_0);
      var outputYAML = document.SerializeAsYaml(OpenApiSpecVersion.OpenApi3_0);
  }


  public static IEdmModel GetEdmModel()

  {
      // load EDM model here...
  }

  ```


  Or with the convert settings:


  ```csharp

  public static void GenerateOpenApiDescription()

  {
      IEdmModel model = GetEdmModel();
      OpenApiConvertSettings settings = new OpenApiConvertSettings
      {
          // configuration
      };
      OpenApiDocument document = model.ConvertToOpenApi(settings);
      var outputJSON = document.SerializeAsJson(OpenApiSpecVersion.OpenApi3_0);
      var outputYAML = document.SerializeAsYaml(OpenApiSpecVersion.OpenApi3_0);
  }


  public static IEdmModel GetEdmModel()

  {
      // load EDM model here...
  }

  ```


  The `GetEdmModel()` method can load a model in 3 ways:


  1. Create the Edm model from scratch. For details refer [building a basic
  model](http://odata.github.io/odata.net/#02-01-build-basic-model)


  2. Load the Edm model from CSDL file. The following shows a code sample that
  loads a model from a csdl file.

      ```csharp
      public static IEdmModel GetEdmModel()
      {
          string csdlFilePath = @"c:\csdl.xml";
          string csdl = System.IO.File.ReadAllText(csdlFilePath);
          IEdmModel model = CsdlReader.Parse(XElement.Parse(csdl).CreateReader());
          return model;
      }
      ```

  3. Create the Edm model using Web API OData model builder. For details refer
  to the [web api model builder
  article](http://odata.github.io/WebApi/#02-01-model-builder-abstract)


  ## Nightly builds


  The nightly build process will upload a Nuget package for OpenAPI.OData.reader
  to [OpenAPIOData MyGet gallery](https://www.myget.org/gallery/openapiodata).


  To connect to OpenAPI.OData.reader feed, use
  [this](https://www.myget.org/F/openapiodata/api/v3/index.json) URL source.


  ## Nuget packages


  The OpenAPI.OData.reader nuget package is at:
  [https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.OpenApi.OData/](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.OpenApi.OData)

  ## Installation


  ```

  pip install aio-openapi

  ```


  ## Development


  Clone the repository and create a virtual environment `venv`.


  Install dependencies by running the install script


  ```

  ./dev/install

  ```


  To run tests


  ```

  pytest --cov

  ```


  ## Features


  - Asynchronous web routes with
  [aiohttp](https://aiohttp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

  - Data validation, serialization and unserialization with python
  [dataclasses](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html)

  - [OpenApi][] v 3 auto documentation

  - [SqlAlchemy][] expression language

  - Asynchronous DB interaction with [asyncpg][]

  - Migrations with [alembic][]

  - SqlAlchemy tables as python dataclasses

  - Support [click][] command line interface

  - Optional [sentry](https://sentry.io) middleware


  ## Web App


  To create an openapi RESTful application follow this schema (lets call the
  file `main.py`)


  ```python

  from openapi.rest import rest


  def create_app():
      return rest(
          openapi=dict(
              title='A REST API',
              ...
          ),
          base_path='/v1',
          allowed_tags=[...],
          validate_docs=True,
          setup_app=setup_app,
          commands=[...]
      )


  def setup_app(app):
      app.router.add_routes(...)
      return app


  if __name__ == '__main__':
      create_app().main()
  ```


  The `create_app` function creates the [aiohttp][] server application by
  invoking the `rest` function.

  This function adds the [click][] command in the `cli` mapping entry and add

  documentation for routes which support OpenAPI docs.

  The `setup_app` function is used to actually setup the custom application,
  usually by adding middleware, routes,

  shutdown callbacks, database integration and so forth.


  ## OpenAPI Documentation


  The library provide tools for creating OpenAPI v 3 compliant endpoints and

  auto-document them.


  An example from test `tests/example` directory


  ```python

  from typing import List


  from aiohttp import web


  from openapi.db.path import SqlApiPath

  from openapi.spec import op



  routes = web.RouteTableDef()



  @routes.view('/tasks')

  class TasksPath(SqlApiPath):
      """
      ---
      summary: Create and query Tasks
      tags:
          - name: Task
            description: Task tag description
      """
      table = 'tasks'

      @op(query_schema=TaskOrderableQuery, response_schema=List[Task])
      async def get(self) -> web.Response:
          """
          ---
          summary: Retrieve Tasks
          description: Retrieve a list of Tasks
          responses:
              200:
                  description: Authenticated tasks
          """
          paginated = await self.get_list()
          return paginated.json_response()

      @op(response_schema=Task, body_schema=TaskAdd)
      async def post(self) -> web.Response:
          """
          ---
          summary: Create a Task
          description: Create a new Task
          responses:
              201:
                  description: the task was successfully added
              422:
                  description: Failed validation
          """
          data = await self.create_one()
          return self.json_response(data, status=201)
  ```


  ## Database Integration


  This library provides integration with [asyncpg][], an high performant
  asynchronous

  connector with [PostgreSql][] database.

  To add the database extension simply use the `get_db` function in the
  applicatiuon `setup_app` function:


  ```python

  from aiohttp import web


  from openapi.db import get_db


  def setup_app(app: web.Application) -> None:
      db = get_db(app)
      meta = db.metadata

  ```


  This will enable database connection and command line tools (most of them from
  [alembic][]):


  ```

  python main.py db --help

  ```


  The database container is available at the `db` app key:


  ```python

  app['db']

  ```


  ## Websockets


  This library provides a simple distributed websocket utility for creating

  websocket remote procedure calls (RPC) and pub/sub.


  ```python

  from aiohttp import web


  from openapi.ws import Sockets


  app = web.Application()

  ...

  app['web_sockets'] = Sockets(app)

  ```


  ### RPC protocol


  The RPC protocol has the following structure for incoming messages


  ```javascript

  {
      "id": "abc",
      "method": "rpc_method_name",
      "payload": {
          ...
      }
  }

  ```


  The `id` is used by clients to link the request with the corresponding
  response.

  The response for an RPC call is eitrher a success


  ```javascript

  {
      "id": "abc",
      "method": "rpc_method_name",
      "response": {
          ...
      }
  }

  ```


  or error


  ```

  {
      "id": "abc",
      "method": "rpc_method_name":
      "error": {
          ...
      }
  }

  ```


  ### Publish/Subscribe


  To subscribe to messages, one need to use the `Subscribe` mixin with the
  subscribe RPC handler.

  Messages take the form:


  ```javascript

  {
      "channel": "channel_name",
      "event": "event_name",
      "data": {
          ...
      }
  }

  ```


  ## Environment Variables


  Several environment variables are used by the library to support testing and
  deployment.


  - `DATASTORE`: PostgreSql connection string (same as [SqlAlchemy][] syntax)

  - `DBPOOL_MIN_SIZE`: minimum size of database connection pool (default is 10)

  - `DBPOOL_MAX_SIZE`: maximum size of database connection pool (default is 10)

  ## Peace of Mind


  The reason this package exists is to give you peace of mind when providing a
  RESTful API. Instead of chasing down preventable bugs and saying sorry to
  consumers, you can focus on more important things in life.


  - Your **API documentation is never out-of-date**, since it is generated out
  of the API document that you write.

  - The documentation comes with **_try-it-out_ examples** for every endpoint in
  your API. You don't have to provide (and maintain) `curl` commands to showcase
  how your API works. Users can try it themselves, right in their browsers.

  - Your **API document is always valid**, since your Pyramid app won't even
  start if the document is not according to OpenAPI 3.0 specification.

  - Automatic request **payload validation and sanitization**. Your views do not
  require any code for validation and input sanitation. Your view code only
  deals with business logic. Tons of tests never need to be written since every
  request, and its payload, is validated against your API document before it
  reaches your view code.

  - Your API **responses always match your API document**. Every response from
  your view is validated against your document and a `500 Internal Server Error`
  is returned if the response does not exactly match what your document says the
  output of a certain API endpoint should be. This decreases the effects of the
  [Hyrum's Law](https://www.hyrumslaw.com).

  - **A single source of truth**. Because of the checks outlined above you can
  be sure that whatever your API document says is in fact what is going on in
  reality. You have a single source of truth to consult when asking an API
  related question, such as "Remind me again, which fields does the endpoint
  /user/info return?".

  - Based on [Pyramid](https://trypyramid.com), a **mature Python Web
  framework**. Companies such as Mozilla, Yelp, RollBar and SurveyMonkey [trust
  Pyramid](https://trypyramid.com/community-powered-by-pyramid.html), and the
  new [pypi.org](https://github.com/pypa/warehouse) runs on Pyramid too. Pyramid
  is thoroughly [tested](https://travis-ci.org/Pylons/pyramid) and
  [documented](http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/latest/),
  providing flexibility, performance, and a large ecosystem of [high-quality
  add-ons](https://trypyramid.com/extending-pyramid.html).


  ## Features


  - Validates your API document (for example, `openapi.yaml` or `openapi.json`)
  against the OpenAPI 3.0 specification using the
  [openapi-spec-validator](https://github.com/p1c2u/openapi-spec-validator).

  - Generates and serves the [Swagger try-it-out
  documentation](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) for your API.

  - Validates incoming requests *and* outgoing responses against your API
  document using [openapi-core](https://github.com/p1c2u/openapi-core).



  ## Getting started


  1. Declare `pyramid_openapi3` as a dependency in your Pyramid project.


  2. Include the following lines:


  ```python

  config.include("pyramid_openapi3")

  config.pyramid_openapi3_spec('openapi.yaml', route='/api/v1/openapi.yaml')

  config.pyramid_openapi3_add_explorer(route='/api/v1/')

  ```


  3. Use the `openapi` [view
  predicate](https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/latest/narr/viewconfig.html#view-configuration-parameters)
  to enable request/response validation:


  ```python

  @view_config(route_name="foobar", openapi=True, renderer='json')

  def myview(request):
      return request.openapi_validated.parameters
  ```


  For requests, `request.openapi_validated` is available with two fields:
  `parameters` and `body`.

  For responses, if the payload does not match the API document, an exception is
  raised.



  ## Demo / Examples


  There are two examples provided with this package:

  * A fairly simple [single-file app providing a Hello World
  API](https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_openapi3/tree/master/examples/singlefile).

  * A slightly more [built-out app providing a TODO app
  API](https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_openapi3/tree/master/examples/todoapp).


  Both examples come with tests that exhibit pyramid_openapi's error handling
  and validation capabilities.


  A **fully built-out app**, with 100% test coverage, providing a
  [RealWorld.io](https://realworld.io) API is available at
  [niteoweb/pyramid-realworld-example-app](https://github.com/niteoweb/pyramid-realworld-example-app).
  It is a Heroku-deployable Pyramid app that provides an API for a
  Medium.com-like social app. You are encouraged to use it as a scaffold for
  your next project.



  ## Design defense


  The authors of pyramid_openapi3 believe that the approach of validating a
  manually-written API document is superior to the approach of generating the
  API document from Python code. Here are the reasons:


  a) Both generation and validation against a document are lossy processes. The
  underlying libraries running the generation/validation will always have
  something missing. Either a feature from the latest OpenAPI specification, or
  an implementation bug. Having to fork the underlying library in order to
  generate the part of your API document that might only be needed for the
  frontend is unfortunate.

     Validation on the other hand allows one to skip parts of validation that are not supported yet, and not block a team from shipping the document.

  b) Validation approach does sacrifice DRY-ness, one has to write the API
  document and then the (view) code in Pyramid. Feels a bit redundant at first.
  However, this provides a clear separation between the intent and the
  implementation.


  c) Generation approach has the drawback of having to write Python code even
  for parts of the API document that the Pyramid backend does not handle, as it
  might be handled by a different system, or be specific only to documentation
  or only to the client side of the API. This bloats your Pyramid codebase with
  code that does not belong there.


  ## Running tests


  You need to have [pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/) and Python 3.7 or
  3.8 installed on your machine. Then you can run:

      $ make tests

  ## Related packages


  These packages tackle the same problem-space:


  - [pyramid_oas3](https://github.com/kazuki/pyramid-oas3) seems to do things
  very similarly to pyramid_openapi3, but the documentation is not in English
  and we sadly can't fully understand what it does just reading the code.

  - [pyramid_swagger](https://github.com/striglia/pyramid_swagger) does a
  similar
    thing, but for Swagger 2.0 documents.
  - [connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) takes the same "write spec
  first, code second" approach as pyramid_openapi3, but is based on Flask.

  - [bottle-swagger](https://github.com/ampedandwired/bottle-swagger) takes the
  same "write spec first, code second" approach too, but is based on Bottle.

  - [pyramid_apispec](https://github.com/ergo/pyramid_apispec) uses generation
  with
    help of apispec and marshmallow validation library. See above [why we prefer validation instead of generation](#design-defense).

  ## Deprecation policy


  We do our best to follow the rules below.


  * Support the latest two releases of Python, currently Python 3.7 and 3.8.

  * Support only a single release of `openapi-core` and its sub-dependencies.
  See `Pipfile.lock` for a frozen-in-time known-good-set of all dependencies.


  ## Use in the wild


  A couple of projects that use pyramid_openapi3 in production:


  - [WooCart API](https://app.woocart.com/api/v1/) - User control panel for
  WooCart Managed WooCommerce service.

  - [Kafkai API](https://app.kafkai.com/api/v1) - User control panel for Kafkai
  text generation service.

  # Open API F# Parser


  Simple library for parsing YAML/JSON Open API (previously called as Swagger)
  specification (version 3.0.1). Originally part of my type provider, but I will
  probably never finish it, so at least community can use part of it for own
  projects. :)


  ## Installation

  First install NuGet package

      Install-Package OpenAPIParser

  or using [Paket](http://fsprojects.github.io/Paket/getting-started.html)

      nuget OpenAPIParser

  ## How to use


  Typically, you would use some existing specification (see [official examples
  for version
  3](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/tree/master/examples/v3.0)):


  ```fsharp

  open OpenAPIParser.Version3.Parser

  let openAPI = Document.loadFromYamlFile "mySpec.yaml" 

  ```


  Then you have basic F# record filled


  ```fsharp

  let version = openAPI.Info.Version

  let title = openAPI.Info.Title

  let paths = openAPI.Paths

  ...

  ```


  Please check [test
  project](https://github.com/Dzoukr/OpenAPIParser/tree/master/tests/OpenAPIParser.Tests)
  for more examples.


  ## Limitations


  Not all properties from [3.0.1
  specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.1.md)
  are implemented. Especially `anyOf` and `oneOf` Schema objects, which will be
  probably implemented in future versions. Please check [Specification record
  definition](https://github.com/Dzoukr/OpenAPIParser/blob/master/src/OpenAPIParser/Version3/Specification.fs)
  for already implemented properties.


  ## Contribution


  You know the drill. Code + Tests = Good PR. Any contribution more than
  welcome!

  This library implements a Koa middleware for

  [OpenAPI
  3.x](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.1.md#requestBodyObject).


  ##

  ```

  npm install exegesis-koa

  ```


  ## Tutorial


  Check out the tutorial
  [here](https://github.com/exegesis-js/exegesis/blob/master/docs/Tutorial.md).


  ## Usage

  ```js

  const Koa = require('koa')

  const path = require('path')

  const exegesisKoa = require('exegesis-koa')


  async function createServer() {
      // See https://github.com/exegesis-js/exegesis/blob/master/docs/Options.md
      const options = {
          controllers: path.resolve(__dirname, './controllers')
      }
      const exegesisMiddleware = exegesisKoa(path.resolve(__dirname, './openapi.yaml'), options)

      const app = new Koa()

      // If you have any body parsers, this should go before them.
      app.use(async (ctx, next) => {
        try {
          await next()
        } catch (err) {
          ctx.status = 500
          ctx.body = `Internal error: ${err.message}`
        }
      })
      app.use(exegesisMiddleware)
      app.use(async (ctx) => {
        if (ctx.status === 404) {
          ctx.status = 404
        }
      })

      app.listen()
  }

  ```


  Calling `exegesiskoa(openApiFile, options)` will return a Promise

  which resolves to a koa middleware.


  `openApiFile` is either a path to your openapi.yaml or openapi.json file,

  or it can be a JSON object with the contents of your OpenAPI document.  This

  should have the
  [`x-exegesis-controller`](https://github.com/exegesis-js/exegesis/blob/master/docs/OAS3%20Specification%20Extensions.md)

  extension defined on any paths you want to be able to access.


  `options` can be [anything you can pass to
  exegesis](https://github.com/exegesis-js/exegesis/blob/master/docs/Options.md). 
  At a

  minimum, you'll probably want to provide `options.controllers`, a path to
  where

  your [controller
  modules](https://github.com/exegesis-js/exegesis/blob/master/docs/Exegesis%20Controllers.md)

  can be found.  If you have any security requirements defined, you'll also

  want to pass in some
  [authenticators](https://github.com/exegesis-js/exegesis/blob/master/docs/OAS3%20Security.md).

  To enable response validation, you'll want to provide a validation callback

  function via
  [`onResponseValidationError()`](https://github.com/exegesis-js/exegesis/blob/master/docs/Options.md#onresponsevalidationerror).

  Exegesis's functionality can also be extended using
  [plugins](https://github.com/exegesis-js/exegesis/tree/master/docs),

  which run on every request.  Plugins let you add functionality like

  [role base
  authorization](https://github.com/exegesis-js/exegesis-plugin-roles),

  or CORS.

  The ctx object is the same as the koa ctx object but also includes:


  ### ctx.parameters.path

  Object where each property is the name of a path parameter applicable to the
  operation and it's provided value.


  ### ctx.parameters.query

  Object where each property is the name of a query parameter applicable to the
  operation and it's provided value.


  parameters declared w/ application/json content will be deserialized


  ## ctx.security

  Object where each property is the name of a security definition applicable to
  the operation and it's provided value.


  for oauth2, value will be the bearer token string  


  for http bearer, value will be the bearer token string  


  for http basic, value will be a `{userId, password}` object

  const getRequestListener = require('listener-from-oas3')

  const http = require('http')


  async function listen(port) {
    const requestListener = await getRequestListener(
      `${__dirname}/openapi.yaml`,
      // resolve handlers from `${__dirname}/${operation-path}/${operation-method}`
      __dirname
    )

    http
      .createServer(requestListener)
      .listen(port)
  }

  ```

ReDoc-ly/create-openapi-repo: "# create-openapi-repo\n\n[![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] [![Dependency Status][daviddm-image]][daviddm-url]\n\n> Generate an organized multi-file OpenAPI repository.\n\n<center>\n\n<img src=\"./logo.png\" width=\"500px\"/>\n\n</center>\n\n## Who?\nYou! Hello.  Do you need to write or contribute to an OpenAPI definition?  If so, read on...\n\n## What?\nWe recommend a docs-like-code approach to OpenAPI definitions:\n- Write it using your favorite text-editor or IDE (we love VSCode).\n- Organize it into multiple files and folders to make it easy to navigate.\n- Store it using source control (such as GitHub).\n- Continuously validate it using our free [openapi-cli tool](https://github.com/redocly/openapi-cli) or our free continuous validation service (coming soon).\n- Bundle it (for a smaller footprint to use in other tools or for tools that do not support a multi-file format).\n\n## Why?\nThere are a few advantages in hosting your API definition on GitHub:\n - Community engagement (PR's and issues -- if you have a public repo)\n - Advertisment in the GitHub community\n - Hosting on GitHub pages (perfect uptime, CDN, Jekyll, custom domains with CNAME)\n - Revision history, branching, CI\n - Review and approval workflows using Pull Requests\n - Fast on-boarding time (developers and tech writers know how to use GitHub :smile:)\n - Fully compatible with Redocly API Reference too\n\n There are also some advantages to a multi-file YAML format OpenAPI definition:\n - Reuse schema objects to keep things DRY (don't repeat yourself) \n - Smaller diffs compared to JSON (especially for markdown descriptions)\n - Easier to navigate\n - Easier to edit with confidence\n\n## Features\nThis generator helps to create a GitHub repo with the following features:\n - Split a big (or small) OpenAPI definition into smaller files organized into folders\n - Bundle it into a single file for deployment\n - Continuous integration/deployment on Travis or Redocly Workflows\n - Code samples as separate files\n - Automate deployment of your OpenAPI definition and docs\n - OpenAPI definition is validated after each commit\n - Live editing in your editor of choice :heart_eyes:\n\n## Structure\n\nYou will have a structure similar to this:\n```\n    ├── .redocly.yaml\n    ├── LICENSE\n    ├── README.md\n    ├── docs\n    │\_\_ ├── favicon.png\n    │\_\_ └── index.html\n    ├── openapi\n    │\_\_ ├── README.md\n    │\_\_ ├── code_samples\n    │\_\_ │\_\_ ├── C#\n    │\_\_ │\_\_ │\_\_ └── echo\n    │\_\_ │\_\_ │\_\_     └── post.cs\n    │\_\_ │\_\_ ├── PHP\n    │\_\_ │\_\_ │\_\_ └── echo\n    │\_\_ │\_\_ │\_\_     └── post.php\n    │\_\_ │\_\_ └── README.md\n    │\_\_ ├── components\n    │\_\_ │\_\_ └── README.md\n    │\_\_ └── paths\n    │\_\_     └── README.md\n    └── package.json\n```\n\nHowever, you can adjust it to any structure you prefer.\n\nThe `openapi` folder is where your OpenAPI definition will live.  Inside there, and the sub-folders, there are `README.md` files to help guide you further. This is also where your entrypoint `openapi.yaml` will live.\n\nThe `components` folder is where you will organize sub-folders such as `schema` to define your schema.\n\nThe `paths` folder is where you will organize your paths. There will be a 'README.md' file in there with suggestions for how to organize it into specially named files (or folders) that use an `@` in place of a `/` (because files cannot have a `/` character in them).  You will also be able to use path parameters by wrapping them in curly braces `{example}`.\n\nThe `.redocly.yaml` file is a universal configuration for various Redocly tools including the lint tool and reference doc engine.\n\n## Commands\n\nThe generated repository includes installing a dependency for our `openapi-cli` tool which supports commands such as `validate`, `bundle`, and more.  There are scripted shortcuts defined in the repository's `package.json`.  \n\n\n## Examples of generated repositories\n- https://github.com/Rebilly/RebillyAPI\n- https://github.com/thingful/openapi-spec\n- https://github.com/TwineHealth/TwineDeveloperDocs\n\n## How to generate your repository\n\nWe assume you already have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.\n\n- Install `create-openapi-repo` globally:\n```bash\nnpm install -g create-openapi-repo\n```\nor use [`npx`](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b):\n\nWe'll use `npx` in this example.  However, remove `npx` if you installed it globally.\n\n```bash\nnpx create-openapi-repo\n```\n\nYou will be presented with some questions. You can create a new definition or use an existing definition to initialize your project.\n\nPlease note, if you do start a new one, remember to [create a GitHub repo](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/#create-a-new-repository-on-github) where your OpenAPI definition will live.\n\nIf you use the prior version of this generated repository, please read the following upgrade instructions.\n\n#### Upgrading from a prior version\n\nMigrate your repository from a previous structure of OpenAPI repo to this newer structure with our migration tool. \n\nRun this in the root folder of your repo.\n\n```bash\nnpx create-openapi-repo --migrate-2-3\n```\n\nNote: the migration tool does not migrate plugins automatically. You would need to manually add them to the `transformers` folder. \n\n## Support\n\nThank you for wanting to support us. Here are some ideas how to support us:\n\n* Star us\n* Tell a friend or colleague about us (or Tweet about us)\n* Write an article about it (and let us know) -- open an issue to let us know, with the link.\n* Consider our commercial products if are looking for automation to ease the docs-like code workflow, hosting along with conveniences like custom domains, access controls and previews, API reference documentation, or a full developer portal:  https://redoc.ly\n\n[npm-image]: https://badge.fury.io/js/generator-openapi-repo.svg\n[npm-url]: https://npmjs.org/package/generator-openapi-repo\n[daviddm-image]: https://david-dm.org/Rebilly/generator-openapi-repo.svg?theme=shields.io\n[daviddm-url]: https://david-dm.org/Rebilly/generator-openapi-repo\n"

  # openapi-preprocessor


  `openapi-preprocessor` is an processing tool that gives flexibility to API
  documentation authors for writing OpenAPI 2.0/3.x specifications.


  [![Travis-CI](https://api.travis-ci.org/dolmen-go/openapi-preprocessor.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dolmen-go/openapi-preprocessor)

  [![Codecov](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/dolmen-go/openapi-preprocessor/master.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/dolmen-go/openapi-preprocessor/branch/master)

  [![Go Report
  Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/dolmen-go/openapi-preprocessor)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/dolmen-go/openapi-preprocessor)


  ## Uses Cases


  - Author your OpenAPI spec in YAML but publish as JSON.

  - Split your OpenAPI spec source in multiple files for authoring, but publish
  a single file.

  - Build multiple specs from shared parts.

  - Merge spec generated from source code with your additional content created
  by hand.

  - Use advanced inlining (`$inline`, `$merge`) to remove duplication (source of
  inconsistencies).

  - Use advanced inlining (`$inline`, `$merge`) to produce complex schemas that
  share subset of properties.

  - Derivate a spec to build a new spec with altered servers settings for
  localhost/staging/preprod environments.

  - *Submit yours...*


  ## Features


  - Every valid OpenAPI 2.0/3.x specification is a valid input (so you can
  easily start refactoring gradually from an existing spec)

  - Allows to build a spec from multiple files; produces a single output file

  - YAML or JSON input

  - Produces an OpenAPI with maximum compatibility with consumming tools:
    - simplifies complex parts of the spec not supported by all tools
    - JSON output
  - Adds a few keywords (`$inline`, `$merge`) that allow to avoid duplication of
  content and ease the writing of consistent documentation

  - Removes unused global schemas (under `/components/schemas`), parameters
  (under `/components/parameters`) and responses (under
  `/components/responses`). This reduces risk of leaking work in progress or
  internal details.


  ## Install


  ### Install from source


  A [Go development environment](https://golang.org/doc/install#install) is
  required. Go 1.12+ recommended.


  Build `openapi-preprocessor` binary and install in `$GOPATH/bin`:

      $ make install

  ## Usage

      openapi-preprocessor [<option>...] <file>

  ## Keywords


  ### `$ref`

      { "$ref": "<file>" }
      { "$ref": "<file>#<pointer>" }
      { "$ref": "#<pointer>" }

  `$ref` is like in OpenAPI, but it can reference content in external files
  using relative URLs as well as intra-document. The referenced part of the
  pointed document is injected into the output document.


  Restrictions:

  - JSON pointer location in the output document will be the same location as in
  the ref link. Example: `{"$ref": "external.yml#/components/parameters/Id"}`
  will import the content to `/components/parameters/Id`. This implies that
  partial files should have the same layout as a full spec (this is a feature as
  it enforces readability of partials).

  - other properties along `$ref` are not allowed as the semantics in JSON
  Schema and Swagger/OpenAPI has evolved and the support in consuming tools may
  vary. Use `$merge` instead that has a strict behaviour in this tool.


  ### `$inline`

      { "$inline": "<file>#<pointer>"}

      {
          "$inline": "<file>#<pointer>",
          "pointer1": <value>, // Overrides value at <file>#<pointer>/pointer1
          "pointer2/slash": <value> // Overrides value deeply at <file>#<pointer>/pointer/slash
      }

  `$inline` is an OpenAPI extension allowing to inject a copy of another part of
  a document in place. Keys along the `$inline` keyword are JSON pointers (with
  the leading `/` removed) allowing to override some parts of the inlined
  content.


  If the target of `$inline` is a `$ref` and `$inline` has overrides, the link
  is dereferenced recursively before inlining.


  Note: deep inlining (inlining a node which itself use `$inline` in its tree)
  might work, but will probably not (see [issue
  #6](https://github.com/dolmen-go/openapi-preprocessor/issues/6) as an
  example). Use instead `$merge` which supports it.


  ### `$merge`

      {
          "$merge": "<file>#<pointer>",
          "key": <value>,
          "key/slash": <value> // Overrides value at <file>#<pointer>/key~1slash
      }

      {
          "$merge": [
              "<file1>#<pointer1>",
              "<file2>#<pointer2>" // Overrides keys from <file1>#<pointer1>
          ]
          "key": <value>,
          "key/slash": <value> // Overrides value at <file2>#<pointer2>/key~1slash
      }


  `$merge` is an OpenAPI extension allowing to copy a node, overriding some
  keys. This is a kind of inlined *`$ref` with keys overrides*.


  ## Examples


  See the
  [testsuite](https://github.com/dolmen-go/openapi-preprocessor/tree/master/testdata).


  Running a basic example:

      $ make
      $ ./openapi-preprocessor testdata/10-ref-ext/input.yml

  # Dredd Transactions


  [![npm
  version](https://badge.fury.io/js/dredd-transactions.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/dredd-transactions)

  [![Build
  Status](https://travis-ci.org/apiaryio/dredd-transactions.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/apiaryio/dredd-transactions)

  [![Build
  status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/hh8l50ssai3p4d3f/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Apiary/dredd-transactions/branch/master)

  [![Known
  Vulnerabilities](https://snyk.io/test/npm/dredd-transactions/badge.svg)](https://snyk.io/test/npm/dredd-transactions)



  Dredd Transactions library compiles *HTTP Transactions* (simple
  Request-Response pairs) from API description document.


  > **Note:** To better understand *emphasized* terms in this documentation,
  please refer to the [Glossary of Terms][api-blueprint-glossary]. All data
  structures are described using the [MSON][mson-spec] format.


  This project supersedes [Blueprint Transactions][blueprint-transactions]
  library.



  ## Features


  * Inherits parameters from parent *Resource* and *Action* sections.

  * Expands *URI Templates*.

  * Warns on undefined placeholders in *URI Templates* (both query and path).

  * Validates URI parameter types.

  * Selects first *Request* and first *Response* if multiple are specified in
  the API description document.



  ### Deprecated Features


  * Compiles [Transaction Name][transaction-object-spec] string (vague
  identifier) for each *Transaction*.

  * Provides [Transaction Origin][transaction-object-spec] with pointers to [API
  Elements][api-elements] derived from the original API description document.


  > **Note:** These features are to be superseded by whatever comes out of the
  proposal in
  [apiaryio/dredd#227](https://github.com/apiaryio/dredd/issues/227).



  ## Installation


  ```

  npm install dredd-transactions

  ```



  ## Development


  Dredd Transactions library is written in JavaScript (ES2015+).



  ## Usage


  ### `parse`


  Parses given API description document into API Elements with options specific

  to Dredd. Assumes that documents with unrecognizable format are

  [API Blueprint][api-blueprint]. Turns any parser failures, including

  the unexpected ones, into [API Elements][api-elements] annotations.


  ```javascript

  const parse = require('dredd-transactions/parse');

  // const { parse } = require('dredd-transactions');


  parse('# My API\n...', (error, parseResult) => {
    // ...
  });

  ```


  ### `compile`


  Compiles *HTTP Transactions* from given [API Elements][api-elements]. *HTTP
  Transactions* are a backbone data structure to Dredd.


  ```javascript

  const compile = require('dredd-transactions/compile');

  // const { compile } = require('dredd-transactions');


  const compileResult = compile(mediaType, apiElements, filename);

  ```


  > **Note:** The `filename` argument is optional and about to get deprecated,
  see [#6][filename-deprecation]



  ## Data Structures


  <a name="parse-result-object"></a>

  ### Parse Result (object)


  Result of parsing.


  - `mediaType`: `text/vnd.apiblueprint` (string, default, nullable) - Media
  type of the input format, can be empty in case of some fatal errors

  - `apiElements` ([API Elements][api-elements]) - API Elements parse result


  <a name="compile-result-object"></a>

  ### Compile Result (object)


  Result of compilation. Alongside compiled
  [Transaction][transaction-object-spec] objects contains also errors and
  warnings, mainly from API description parser.


  - `mediaType`: `text/vnd.apiblueprint` (string, default, nullable) - Media
  type of the input format, defaults to API Blueprint format. Can be empty in
  case of some fatal errors.

  - `transactions` (array[[Transaction][transaction-object-spec]]) - Compiled
  _HTTP Transactions_.

  - `annotations` (array[[Annotation][annotation-object-spec]]) - Errors and
  warnings which occurred during parsing of the API description or during
  compilation of transactions.


  <a name="transaction-object"></a>

  ### Transaction (object)


  Represents a single *HTTP Transaction* (Request-Response pair) and its
  location in the API description document. The location is provided in two
  forms, both **deprecated** as of now:


  - `name` - String representation, both human- and machine-readable.

  - `origin` - Object of references to nodes of [API Elements][api-elements]
  derived from the original API description document.


  > **Note:** These two forms of locating HTTP Transactions are to be superseded
  by whatever comes out of the proposal in
  [apiaryio/dredd#227](https://github.com/apiaryio/dredd/issues/227).



  ### Properties


  - request (object) - HTTP Request as described in API description document.
      - method
      - uri: `/message` (string) - Informative URI of the Request.
      - headers (array) - List of HTTP headers in their original order, with the original casing of the header name, including multiple headers of the same name.
          - (object)
              - name: `Content-Type` (string)
              - value: `text/plain` (string)
      - body: `Hello world!\n` (string)
  - response (object) - Expected HTTP Response as described in API description
  document.
      - status: `200` (string)
      - headers (array) - List of HTTP headers in their original order, with the original casing of the header name, including multiple headers of the same name.
          - (object)
              - name: `Content-Type` (string)
              - value: `text/plain` (string)
      - body (string, optional)
      - schema (string, optional)


  ### Deprecated Properties


  - name: `Hello world! > Retrieve Message` (string) - Transaction Name,
  non-deterministic breadcrumb location of the HTTP Transaction within the API
  description document.

  - origin (object) - Object of references to nodes of [API
  Elements][api-elements] derived from the original API description document.
      - filename: `./api-description.apib` (string)
      - apiName: `My Api` (string)
      - resourceGroupName: `Greetings` (string)
      - resourceName: `Hello, world!` (string)
      - actionName: `Retrieve Message` (string)
      - exampleName: `First example` (string)

  > **Note:** These properties are to be superseded by whatever comes out of the
  proposal in
  [apiaryio/dredd#227](https://github.com/apiaryio/dredd/issues/227).



  <a name="annotation-object"></a>

  ### Annotation (object)


  Description of an error or warning which occurred during parsing of the API
  description or during compilation of transactions.


  #### Properties


  - type (enum[string])
      - `error`
      - `warning`
  - component (enum[string]) - In which component of the compilation process the
  annotation occurred
      - `apiDescriptionParser`
      - `parametersValidation`
      - `uriTemplateExpansion`
  - message (string) - Textual annotation. This is – in most cases – a
  human-readable message to be displayed to user

  - location (array, fixed, nullable) - Location of the annotation in the source
  file, represented by a single range of line and column number pairs if
  available, or by `null` otherwise
      - (array) - Start location
          - (number) - Line number
          - (number) - Column number
      - (array) - End location
          - (number) - Line number
          - (number) - Column number

  ### Deprecated Properties


  - name: `Hello world! > Retrieve Message` (string) - Transaction Name,
  non-deterministic breadcrumb location of the relevant HTTP Transaction within
  the API description document.

  - origin (object) - Object of references to nodes of [API
  Elements][api-elements] derived from the original API description document.
      - filename: `./api-description.apib` (string)
      - apiName: `My Api` (string)
      - resourceGroupName: `Greetings` (string)
      - resourceName: `Hello, world!` (string)

  ## Quick start


  Download latest binary and run a server.


  ```bash

  # runs a local server on port 8080

  ./openapi-mock serve --specification-url
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/master/examples/v3.0/petstore.yaml


  # to test that the server successfully ran

  curl 'http://localhost:8080/v1/pets'

  ```


  Alternatively, you can use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image.


  ```bash

  # downloads an image

  docker pull muonsoft/openapi-mock


  # runs a docker container with exported port 8080

  docker run -p 8080:8080 -e
  "OPENAPI_MOCK_SPECIFICATION_URL=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/master/examples/v3.0/petstore.yaml"
  --rm muonsoft/openapi-mock


  # to test that the server successfully ran

  curl 'http://localhost:8080/v1/pets'

  ```


  Also, you can use [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). Example
  of `docker-compose.yml`


  ```yaml

  version: '3.0'


  services:
    openapi_mock:
      container_name: openapi_mock
      image: muonsoft/openapi-mock
      environment:
        OPENAPI_MOCK_SPECIFICATION_URL: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/master/examples/v3.0/petstore.yaml'
      ports:
        - "8080:8080"
  ```


  To start up a container run command.


  ```bash

  docker-compose up -d

  ```

  ## TLDR; what is this?


  A code generator for OpenAPI and Yii Framework based PHP API application.


  Input: [OpenAPI 3.0 YAML or
  JSON](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification#the-openapi-specification)
  (via [cebe/php-openapi](https://github.com/cebe/php-openapi))


  Output: Yii Framework Application with Controllers, Models, database schema



  ## Features


  Currently available features:


  - Generate Path mappings, **Controllers** and Actions **for API Endpoints**.
  CRUD Endpoints are ready-to-use, other Endpoints are generated as abstract
  functions that need to be implemented

  - Generate **Models** and validation based on OpenAPI Schema

  - Generate **Database Schema** from OpenAPI Schema

  - Generates **Database Migrations** for schema changes

  - Provide **Dummy Data** via Faker for development


  ## Requirements


  - PHP 7.1 or higher (works fine with PHP 8)



  ## Install

      composer require cebe/yii2-openapi:^2.0@beta

  ## Usage


  You can use this package in your existing application or start a new project
  using the

  [yii2-app-api](https://github.com/cebe/yii2-app-api) application template.

  For usage of the template, see instructions in the template repo readme.


  In your existing Yii application config (works for console as well as web):


  ```php

  <?php

  $config = [
      // ... this is your application config ...
  ];


  if (YII_ENV_DEV) {
      // enable Gii module
      $config['bootstrap'][] = 'gii';
      $config['modules']['gii'] = [
          'class' => \yii\gii\Module::class,
          'generators' => [
              // add ApiGenerator to Gii module
              'api' => \cebe\yii2openapi\generator\ApiGenerator::class,

              // --------- OR ---------
              // to disable generation of migrations files or with default config change
              'api' => [
                'class' => \cebe\yii2openapi\generator\ApiGenerator::class,
                'generateMigrations' => false, # this config can also be applied in CLI command
              ],
          ],
      ];
  }


  return $config;

  ```


  To use the web generator, open `index.php?r=gii` and select the `REST API
  Generator`.


  On console you can run the generator with `./yii gii/api
  --openApiPath=@app/openapi.yaml`. Where `@app/openapi.yaml` should be the
  absolute path to your OpenAPI spec file. This can be JSON as well as YAML (see
  also [cebe/php-openapi](https://github.com/cebe/php-openapi/) for supported
  formats).


  Run `./yii gii/api --help` for all options. Example: Disable generation of
  migrations files `./yii gii/api --generateMigrations=0`


  See [Petstore
  example](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/examples/v3.0/petstore.yaml)
  for example OpenAPI spec.



  ## OpenAPI extensions


  This library understands the following extensions to the OpenAPI spec:


  ### `x-faker`


  You may specify custom PHP code for generating fake data for a property:


  ```yaml
      Post:
        properties:
          id:
            type: integer
          tags:
            type: array
            items:
              type: string
            example: ['one', 'two']
            x-faker: "$faker->randomElements(['one', 'two', 'three', 'four'])"
  ```


  ### `x-table`


  Specify the table name for a Schema that defines a model which is stored in
  the database.

  You can generate non-db model based on \yii\base\Model without migrations by
  setting `x-table: false`


  ### `x-pk`


  Explicitly specify primary key name for table, if it is different from "id" 


  ```yaml
      Post:
        x-table: posts
        x-pk: uid
        properties:
          uid:
             type: integer
          title:
             type: string
  ```


  ### `x-db-type`


  Explicitly specify the database type for a column. (MUST contain only real DB
  type! (`json`, `jsonb`, `uuid`, `varchar` etc.)).

  If `x-db-type` is set to `false`, property will be processed as virtual;

  It will be added in model as public property, but skipped for migrations
  generation.


  Example values of `x-db-type` are:

   - `false` (boolean false)
   - as string and its value can be like:
       - text
       - text[]
       - INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT
       - decimal(12,4)
       - json
       - varchar
       - VARCHAR
       - SMALLINT UNSIGNED ZEROFILL
       - MEDIUMINT(10) UNSIGNED ZEROFILL COMMENT "comment" (note the double quotes here)

  Such values are not allowed:
     - `int null default null after low_price` (null and default will be handled by `nullable` and `default` keys respectively)
     - MEDIUMINT(10) UNSIGNED ZEROFILL NULL DEFAULT '7' COMMENT 'comment' AFTER `seti`, ADD INDEX `t` (`w`)

  ### `x-indexes`


  Specify table indexes


  ```yaml
      Post:
        x-table: posts
        x-indexes:
            - 'visible,publish_date'
            - 'unique:title' #for unique attributes also unique validation check will be added
            - 'gist:metadata' #for postgres will generate index using GIST index type
        properties:
          id:
             type: integer
             x-db-type: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT
          title:
             type: string
          visible:
              type: boolean
          publish_date:
              type: string
              format: date
          metadata:
             type: object
             x-db-type: JSON
             default: '{}' 
  ```


  ### `x-db-default-expression`


  Ability to provide default value by database expression


  ```yaml

  created_at:
    readOnly: true
    type: string
    format: datetime
    x-db-type: datetime
    nullable: false
    x-db-default-expression: current_timestamp()
  ```


  Note: If both `default` and `x-db-default-expression` are present then
  `default` will be considered.


  ```yaml

  created_at:
    readOnly: true
    type: string
    format: datetime
    x-db-type: datetime
    nullable: false
    x-db-default-expression: current_timestamp() # this will be ignored
    default: "2011-11-11" # this will be considered
  ```


  Also see: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/data-type-defaults.html


  ### `x-fk-on-delete`


  Allow to set foreign key constraint in migrations for ON DELETE event of row
  in database table. Example:


  ```yaml
    components:
      schemas:
        User:
          type: object
          description: x on-x (update|delete) foreign key constraint
          properties:
            id:
              type: integer
            name:
              type: string
        Post:
          type: object
          description: x on-x (update|delete) foreign key constraint
          properties:
            id:
              type: integer
            title:
              type: string
            user:
              allOf:
                - $ref: '#/components/schemas/User'
                - x-fk-on-update: CASCADE
            user_2:
              allOf:
                - $ref: '#/components/schemas/User'
                - x-fk-on-update: CASCADE
                - x-fk-on-delete: SET NULL
            user_3:
              allOf:
                - $ref: '#/components/schemas/User'
                - x-fk-on-delete: SET NULL
            user_4:
              $ref: '#/components/schemas/User' # without any constraints
  ```


  ### `x-fk-on-update`


  Allow to set foreign key constraint in migrations for ON UPDATE event of row
  in database table. For example, see above section for `x-fk-on-delete`.


  ## Many-to-Many relation definition


  There are two ways for define many-to-many relations:


  ### Simple many-to-many without junction model

     - property name for many-to-many relation should be equal lower-cased, pluralized related schema name
       
     - referenced schema should contains mirrored reference to current schema
       
     - migration for junction table can be generated automatically - table name should be [pluralized, lower-cased
   schema_name1]2[pluralized, lower-cased schema name2], in alphabetical order;
   For example, for schemas Post and Tag - table should be posts2tags, for schemas Post and Attachement - table should
    be attachments2posts
    
  ```

  Post:
    properties:
    ...
      tags:
        type: array
        items:
          $ref: '#/components/schemas/Tag'

  Tag:
    properties:
    ...
      posts:
        type: array
        items:
          $ref: '#/components/schemas/Post'
  ```
    
  ### Many-to-many with junction model


  This way allowed creating multiple many-to-many relations between to models 


  - define junction schema with all necessary attributes. There are only one
  important requirement - the junction
   schema name
   must be started with prefix 'junction_' (This prefix will be used internally only and
   will be trimmed before table and model generation)
   
  ```

  # Model TeamMembers with table team_members will be generated with columns
  team_id, user_id and role

  junction_TeamMembers:
     team:
        $ref: '#/components/schemas/Team'
     user:
        $ref: '#/components/schemas/User'
     role:
       type: string
  ```

  - Both many-to-many related schemas must have properties with reference to
  "junction_*" schema. These properties will be
   used as relation names 

  ```

  Team:
    properties:
    ...
       team_members:
         type: array
         items:
           $ref: '#/components/schemas/junction_TeamMembers'

  User:
    properties:
    ...
      memberships: #You absolutely free with naming for relationship attributes
        type: array
        items:
          $ref: '#/components/schemas/junction_TeamMembers'
  ```
    
   - see both examples here [tests/specs/many2many.yaml](tests/specs/many2many.yaml)
   

  ## Handling of `NOT NULL` constraints


  `NOT NULL` in DB migrations is determined by `nullable` and `required`
  properties of the OpenAPI schema.

  e.g. attribute = 'my_property'.


  - If you define attribute neither "required" nor via "nullable", then it is by
  default `NULL`:


  ```yaml
    ExampleSchema:
      properties:
        my_property:
          type: string
  ```


  - If you define attribute in "required", then it is `NOT NULL`


  ```yaml
    ExampleSchema:
      required:
       - my_property
      properties:
        my_property:
          type: string
  ```


  - If you define attribute via "nullable", then it overrides "required", e.g.
  allow `NULL` in this case:


  ```yaml
    ExampleSchema:
      required:
        - my_property
      properties:
        my_property:
          type: string
          nullable: true
  ```


  - If you define attribute via "nullable", then it overrides "required", e.g.
  `NOT NULL` in this case:


  ```yaml
    test_table:
      required:
      properties:
        my_property:
          type: string
          nullable: false
  ```


  ## Handling of `enum` (#enum)

  It works on all 3 DB: MySQL, MariaDb and PgSQL.

   ```yaml
    test_table:
      properties:
        my_property:
          enum:
            - one
            - two
            - three
  ```


  Note: Change in enum values are not very simple. For Mysql and Mariadb,
  migrations will be generated but in many cases custom modification in it are
  required. For Pgsql migrations for change in enum values will not be
  generated. It should be handled manually.


  ## Handling of `numeric` (#numeric, #MariaDb)


  precision-default = 10

  scale-default = 2


  - You can define attribute like "numeric(precision,scale)":
   ```yaml
    test_table:
      properties:
        my_property:
          x-db-type: decimal(12,4)
  ```

  DB-Result = decimal(12,4)


  - You can define attribute like "numeric(precision)" with default
  scale-default = 2:
   ```yaml
    test_table:
      properties:
        my_property:
          x-db-type: decimal(12)
  ```

  DB-Result = decimal(12,2)


  - You can define attribute like "numeric" with precision-default = 10 and
  scale-default = 2:
   ```yaml
    test_table:
      properties:
        my_property:
          x-db-type: decimal
  ```

  DB-Result = decimal(10,2)



  ## Assumptions


  When generating code from an OpenAPI description there are many possible ways
  to achive a fitting result.

  Thus there are some assumptions and limitations that are currently applied to
  make this work.

  Here is a (possibly incomplete) list:


  - The current implementation works best with OpenAPI description that follows
  the [JSON:API](https://jsonapi.org/) guidelines.
    - The request and response format/schema is currently not extracted from OpenAPI schema and may need to be adjusted manually if it does not follow JSON:API
  - column/field/property with name `id` is considered as Primary Key by this
  library and it is automatically handled by DB/Yii; so remove it from
  validation `rules()`
    - other fields can currently be used as primary keys using the `x-pk` OpenAPI extension (see below) but it may not be work correctly in all cases, please report bugs if you find them.

  Other things to keep in mind:


  ### Adding columns to existing tables


  When adding new fields in the API models, new migrations will be generated to
  add these fields to the table.

  For a project that is already in production, it should be considered to adjust
  the generated migration to add default

  values for existing data records.


  One case where this is important is the addition of a new column with `NOT
  NULL` contraint, which does not provide a default value.

  Such a migration will fail when the table is not empty:


  ```php

  $this->addColumn('{{%company}}', 'name', $this->string(128)->notNull());

  ```


  Fails on a PostgreSQL database with


  > add column name string(128) NOT NULL to table {{%company}} ...Exception:
  SQLSTATE[23502]: Not null violation: 7 ERROR:  column "name" contains null
  values


  The solution would be to create the column, allowing NULL, set the value to a
  default and add the null constraint later.


  ```php

  $this->addColumn('{{%company}}', 'name', $this->string(128)->null());

  $this->update('{{%company}}', ['name' => 'No name']);

  $this->alterColumn('{{%company}}', 'name', $this->string(128)->notNull());

  ```

Add as many routes as you like and point each route your express handler functions.\n2. `server/common/api.yaml` - This file contains your [OpenAPI spec](https://swagger.io/specification/). Describe your API here. It's recommended that you to declare any and all validation logic in this YAML. `express-no-stress-typescript`  uses [express-openapi-validator](https://github.com/cdimascio/express-openapi-validator) to automatically handle all API validation based on what you've defined in the spec.\n\n**Q**: I previously generated an app, but I want to change the API root. How do I do this?\n\n**A**: You need to make to small changes\n  1. Modify `server/routes.js`\n  ```javascript\n     // Change your original path e.g. /api/v1/examples, to:\n     app.use('/api/v2/examples', examplesRouter);\n   ```\n\n  2. Modify `server/common/api.yaml` and update the api root:\n  ```yaml\n    # Change e.g. /api/v1 to /api/v2\n    servers:\n    - url: /api/v2   \n  ```\n\n## License\n\n[MIT](LICENSE)\n\n\n<a href=\"https://www.buymeacoffee.com/m97tA5c\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://bmc-cdn.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/BMC-button-images/custom_images/yellow_img.png\" alt=\"Buy Me A Coffee\" style=\"height: auto !important;width: auto !important;\" ></a>\n\n## Contributors ✨\n\nThanks goes to these wonderful people ([emoji key](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key)):\n\n<!-- ALL-CONTRIBUTORS-LIST:START - Do not remove or modify this section -->\n<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->\n<!-- markdownlint-disable -->\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://github.com/leosuncin\"><img src=\"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/4307697?v=4\" width=\"100px;\" alt=\"\"/><br /><sub><b>Jaime Leonardo Suncin Cruz</b></sub></a><br /><a href=\"https://github.com/cdimascio/generator-express-no-stress/commits?author=leosuncin\" title=\"Code\">\U0001F4BB</a></td>\n    <td align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://github.com/amygdaloideum\"><img src=\"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/18416252?v=4\" width=\"100px;\" alt=\"\"/><br /><sub><b>Daniel Bornstrand</b></sub></a><br /><a href=\"https://github.com/cdimascio/generator-express-no-stress/commits?author=amygdaloideum\" title=\"Code\">\U0001F4BB</a></td>\n    <td align=\"center\"><a href=\"http://www.about.me/jasoncorns\"><img src=\"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/3839416?v=4\" width=\"100px;\" alt=\"\"/><br /><sub><b>Jason Corns</b></sub></a><br /><a href=\"https://github.com/cdimascio/generator-express-no-stress/commits?author=JasonAllenCorns\" title=\"Documentation\">\U0001F4D6</a></td>\n    <td align=\"center\"><a href=\"http://frankcalise.com\"><img src=\"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/374022?v=4\" width=\"100px;\" alt=\"\"/><br /><sub><b>Frank Calise</b></sub></a><br /><a href=\"https://github.com/cdimascio/generator-express-no-stress/commits?author=frankcalise\" title=\"Documentation\">\U0001F4D6</a></td>\n    <td align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://blog.daskepon.com/\"><img src=\"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6374952?v=4\" width=\"100px;\" alt=\"\"/><br /><sub><b>Daisuke Tsuji</b></sub></a><br /><a href=\"https://github.com/cdimascio/generator-express-no-stress/commits?author=daskepon\" title=\"Documentation\">\U0001F4D6</a></td>\n    <td align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://github.com/uronly14me\"><img src=\"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/5186814?v=4\" width=\"100px;\" alt=\"\"/><br /><sub><b>Sangbeom Han</b></sub></a><br /><a href=\"https://github.com/cdimascio/generator-express-no-stress/commits?author=uronly14me\" title=\"Documentation\">\U0001F4D6</a></td>\n    <td align=\"center\"><a href=\"http://mkly.io\"><img src=\"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/965353?v=4\" width=\"100px;\" alt=\"\"/><br /><sub><b>Mike Lay</b></sub></a><br /><a href=\"https://github.com/cdimascio/generator-express-no-stress/commits?author=mkly\" title=\"Documentation\">\U0001F4D6</a></td>\n    <td align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://github.com/jodejar214\"><img src=\"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/9385902?v=4\" width=\"100px;\" alt=\"\"/><br /><sub><b>jodejar214</b></sub></a><br /><a href=\"https://github.com/cdimascio/generator-express-no-stress/commits?author=jodejar214\" title=\"Code\">\U0001F4BB</a></td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n<!-- markdownlint-enable -->\n<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->\n<!-- ALL-CONTRIBUTORS-LIST:END -->\n\nThis project follows the [all-contributors](https://github.com/all-contributors/all-contributors) specification.

deepmap/oapi-codegen: "## OpenAPI Client and Server Code Generator\n\n⚠️ This README may be for the latest development version, which may contain\nunreleased changes. Please ensure you're looking at the README for the latest\nrelease version.\n\nThis package contains a set of utilities for generating Go boilerplate code for\nservices based on\n[OpenAPI 3.0](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md)\nAPI definitions. When working with services, it's important to have an API\ncontract which servers and clients both implement to minimize the chances of\nincompatibilities. It's tedious to generate Go models which precisely correspond to\nOpenAPI specifications, so let our code generator do that work for you, so that\nyou can focus on implementing the business logic for your service.\n\nWe have chosen to focus on [Echo](https://github.com/labstack/echo) as\nour default HTTP routing engine, due to its speed and simplicity for the generated\nstubs. [Chi](https://github.com/go-chi/chi), [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin),\n[gorilla/mux](https://github.com/gorilla/mux), [Fiber](https://github.com/gofiber/fiber), and\n[Iris](https://github.com/kataras/iris) have also been added by contributors as additional routers.\nWe chose Echo because the `Context` object is a mockable interface, and it allows for some advanced\ntesting.\n\nThis package tries to be too simple rather than too generic, so we've made some\ndesign decisions in favor of simplicity, knowing that we can't generate strongly\ntyped Go code for all possible OpenAPI Schemas. If there is a way to accomplish\nsomething via utility code or reflection, it's probably a better approach than\ncode generation, which is fragile due to the very dynamic nature of OpenAPI and\nthe very static nature of Go.\n\n## Contributing\n\nI would like to pre-emptively extend my gratitude to anyone who takes the time\nto improve this project.\n\nOapi-codegen is being actively maintained, however the two people who do so\nare very busy, and can only set aside time for this project every once in a while,\nso our release cadence is slow and conservative.\n\nGenerating code which others depend on, which is based on something as complex\nas OpenAPI is fraught with many edge cases, and we prefer to leave things as\nthey are if there is a reasonable workaround.\n\nIf you do find a case where oapi-codegen is broken, and would like to submit a PR,\nwe are very grateful, and will happily look at it.\n\nSince most commits affect generated code, before sending your PR, please\nensure that all boilerplate has been regenerated. You can do this from the top level\nof the repository by running:\n\n    make generate\n\nI realize that our code isn't entirely idiomatic with respect to comments, and\nvariable naming and initialisms, especially the generated code, but I'm reluctant\nto merge PR's which change this, due to the breakage they will cause for others. If \nyou rename anything under `/pkg` or change the names of variables in generated\ncode, you will break other people's code. It's safe to rename internal names.\n\n## Overview\n\nWe're going to use the OpenAPI example of the\n[Expanded Petstore](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/examples/v3.0/petstore-expanded.yaml)\nin the descriptions below, please have a look at it.\n\nIn order to create a Go server to serve this exact schema, you would have to\nwrite a lot of boilerplate code to perform all the marshaling and unmarshaling\ninto objects which match the OpenAPI 3.0 definition. The code generator in this\ndirectory does a lot of that for you. You would run it like so:\n\n    go install github.com/deepmap/oapi-codegen/cmd/oapi-codegen@latest\n    oapi-codegen -package petstore petstore-expanded.yaml > petstore.gen.go\n\nLet's go through that `petstore.gen.go` file to show you everything which was\ngenerated.\n\n## Generated Server Boilerplate\n\nThe `/components/schemas` section in OpenAPI defines reusable objects, so Go\ntypes are generated for these. The Pet Store example defines `Error`, `Pet`,\n`Pets` and `NewPet`, so we do the same in Go:\n\n```go\n// Error defines model for Error.\ntype Error struct {\n    // Error code\n    Code int32 `json:\"code\"`\n\n    // Error message\n    Message string `json:\"message\"`\n}\n\n// NewPet defines model for NewPet.\ntype NewPet struct {\n    // Name of the pet\n    Name string `json:\"name\"`\n\n    // Type of the pet\n    Tag *string `json:\"tag,omitempty\"`\n}\n\n// Pet defines model for Pet.\ntype Pet struct {\n    // Unique id of the pet\n    Id int64 `json:\"id\"`\n\n    // Name of the pet\n    Name string `json:\"name\"`\n\n    // Type of the pet\n    Tag *string `json:\"tag,omitempty\"`\n}\n\n// Type definition for component schema \"Pets\"\ntype Pets []Pet\n```\n\nIt's best to define objects under `/components` field in the schema, since\nthose will be turned into named Go types. If you use inline types in your\nhandler definitions, we will generate inline, anonymous Go types, but those\nare more tedious to deal with since you will have to redeclare them at every\npoint of use.\n\nFor each element in the `paths` map in OpenAPI, we will generate a Go handler\nfunction in an interface object. Here is the generated Go interface for our\nEcho server.\n\n```go\ntype ServerInterface interface {\n    //  (GET /pets)\n    FindPets(ctx echo.Context, params FindPetsParams) error\n    //  (POST /pets)\n    AddPet(ctx echo.Context) error\n    //  (DELETE /pets/{id})\n    DeletePet(ctx echo.Context, id int64) error\n    //  (GET /pets/{id})\n    FindPetById(ctx echo.Context, id int64) error\n}\n```\n\nThese are the functions which you will implement yourself in order to create\na server conforming to the API specification. Normally, all the arguments and\nparameters are stored on the `echo.Context` in handlers, so we do the tedious\nwork of unmarshaling the JSON automatically, simply passing values into\nyour handlers.\n\nNotice that `FindPetById` takes a parameter `id int64`. All path arguments\nwill be passed as arguments to your function, since they are mandatory.\n\nRemaining arguments can be passed in headers, query arguments or cookies. Those\nwill be written to a `params` object. Look at the `FindPets` function above, it\ntakes as input `FindPetsParams`, which is defined as follows:\n\n```go\n// Parameters object for FindPets\ntype FindPetsParams struct {\n   Tags  *[]string `json:\"tags,omitempty\"`\n   Limit *int32   `json:\"limit,omitempty\"`\n}\n```\n\nThe HTTP query parameter `limit` turns into a Go field named `Limit`. It is\npassed by pointer, since it is an optional parameter. If the parameter is\nspecified, the pointer will be non-`nil`, and you can read its value.\n\nIf you changed the OpenAPI specification to make the parameter required, the\n`FindPetsParams` structure will contain the type by value:\n\n```go\ntype FindPetsParams struct {\n    Tags  *[]string `json:\"tags,omitempty\"`\n    Limit int32     `json:\"limit\"`\n}\n```\n\n### Registering handlers\n\nThere are a few ways of registering your http handler based on the type of server generated i.e. `-generate server` or `-generate chi-server`\n\n<details><summary><code>Echo</code></summary>\n\nCode generated using `-generate server`.\n\nThe usage of `Echo` is out of scope of this doc, but once you have an\necho instance, we generate a utility function to help you associate your handlers\nwith this autogenerated code. For the pet store, it looks like this:\n\n```go\nfunc RegisterHandlers(router codegen.EchoRouter, si ServerInterface) {\n    wrapper := ServerInterfaceWrapper{\n        Handler: si,\n    }\n    router.GET(\"/pets\", wrapper.FindPets)\n    router.POST(\"/pets\", wrapper.AddPet)\n    router.DELETE(\"/pets/:id\", wrapper.DeletePet)\n    router.GET(\"/pets/:id\", wrapper.FindPetById)\n}\n```\n\nThe wrapper functions referenced above contain generated code which pulls\nparameters off the `Echo` request context, and unmarshals them into Go objects.\n\nYou would register the generated handlers as follows:\n\n```go\nfunc SetupHandler() {\n    var myApi PetStoreImpl  // This implements the pet store interface\n    e := echo.New()\n    petstore.RegisterHandlers(e, &myApi)\n    ...\n}\n```\n\n</summary></details>\n\n<details><summary><code>Chi</code></summary>\n\nCode generated using `-generate chi-server`.\n\n```go\ntype PetStoreImpl struct {}\nfunc (*PetStoreImpl) GetPets(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n    // Implement me\n}\n\nfunc SetupHandler() {\n    var myApi PetStoreImpl\n\n    r := chi.NewRouter()\n    r.Mount(\"/\", Handler(&myApi))\n}\n```\n\n</summary></details>\n\n<details><summary><code>Gin</code></summary>\n\nCode generated using `-generate gin`.\n\nThe usage of `gin` is out of scope of this doc, but once you have an\ngin instance, we generate a utility function to help you associate your handlers\nwith this autogenerated code. For the pet store, it looks like this:\n\n```go\n// RegisterHandlersWithOptions creates http.Handler with additional options\nfunc RegisterHandlersWithOptions(router *gin.Engine, si ServerInterface, options GinServerOptions) *gin.Engine {\n\twrapper := ServerInterfaceWrapper{\n\t\tHandler:            si,\n\t\tHandlerMiddlewares: options.Middlewares,\n\t}\n\n\trouter.GET(options.BaseURL+\"/pets\", wrapper.FindPets)\n\trouter.POST(options.BaseURL+\"/pets\", wrapper.AddPet)\n\trouter.DELETE(options.BaseURL+\"/pets/:id\", wrapper.DeletePet)\n\trouter.GET(options.BaseURL+\"/pets/:id\", wrapper.FindPetByID)\n\treturn router\n}\n```\n\n```go\nimport (\n\t\"github.com/gin-gonic/gin\"\n\t\"github.com/deepmap/oapi-codegen/examples/petstore-expanded/gin/api\"\n\tmiddleware \"github.com/oapi-codegen/gin-middleware\"\n)\n\ntype PetStoreImpl struct {}\nfunc (*PetStoreImpl) GetPets(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n    // Implement me\n}\n\nfunc SetupHandler() {\n    var myApi PetStoreImpl\n\n    r := gin.Default()\n\t  r.Use(middleware.OapiRequestValidator(swagger))\n    r = api.RegisterHandlers(r, petStore)\n}\n```\n\n</summary></details>\n\n<details><summary><code>net/http</code></summary>\n\n[Chi](https://github.com/go-chi/chi) is 100% compatible with `net/http` allowing the following with code generated using `-generate chi-server`.\n\n```go\ntype PetStoreImpl struct {}\nfunc (*PetStoreImpl) GetPets(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n    // Implement me\n}\n\nfunc SetupHandler() {\n    var myApi PetStoreImpl\n\n    http.Handle(\"/\", Handler(&myApi))\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively, [Gorilla](https://github.com/gorilla/mux) is also 100% compatible with `net/http` and can be generated with `-generate gorilla`.\n\n</summary></details>\n\n<details><summary><code>Iris</code></summary>\n\nCode generated using `-generate iris`.\n\nThe usage of `iris` is out of scope of this doc, but once you have an\ngin instance, we generate a utility function to help you associate your handlers\nwith this autogenerated code. For the pet store, it looks like this:\n\n```go\n// RegisterHandlersWithOptions creates http.Handler with additional options\nfunc RegisterHandlersWithOptions(router *iris.Application, si ServerInterface, options IrisServerOptions) {\n\n\twrapper := ServerInterfaceWrapper{\n\t\tHandler: si,\n\t}\n\n\trouter.Get(options.BaseURL+\"/pets\", wrapper.FindPets)\n\trouter.Post(options.BaseURL+\"/pets\", wrapper.AddPet)\n\trouter.Delete(options.BaseURL+\"/pets/:id\", wrapper.DeletePet)\n\trouter.Get(options.BaseURL+\"/pets/:id\", wrapper.FindPetByID)\n\n\trouter.Build()\n}\n```\n\n```go\nimport (\n\t\"github.com/kataras/iris/v12\"\n\t\"github.com/deepmap/oapi-codegen/examples/petstore-expanded/iris/api\"\n\tmiddleware \"github.com/oapi-codegen/iris-middleware\"\n)\n```\n\nThe wrapper functions referenced above contain generated code which pulls\nparameters off the `Iris` request context, and unmarshals them into Go objects.\n\nYou would register the generated handlers as follows:\n\n```go\nfunc SetupHandler() {\n    var myApi PetStoreImpl\n\n    i := iris.Default()\n\t  i.Use(middleware.OapiRequestValidator(swagger))\n    api.RegisterHandlers(r, &myApi)\n}\n```\n\n</summary></details>\n\n#### Strict server generation\n\noapi-codegen also supports generating RPC inspired strict server, that will parse request bodies and encode responses.\nThe main points of this code is to automate some parsing, abstract user code from server specific code,\nand also to force user code to comply with the schema.\nIt supports binding of `application/json` and `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` to a struct, for `multipart` requests\nit generates a `multipart.Reader`, which can be used to either manually iterating over parts or using `runtime.BindMultipart`\nfunction to bind the form to a struct. All other content types are represented by a `io.Reader` interface.\n\nTo form a response simply return one of the generated structs with corresponding status code and content type. For example,\nto return a status code 200 JSON response for a AddPet use the `AddPet200JSONResponse` struct which will set the correct\nContent-Type header, status code and will marshal the response data. You can also return an error, that will\ncause an `Internal Server Error` response.\n\nShort example:\n\n```go\ntype PetStoreImpl struct {}\nfunc (*PetStoreImpl) GetPets(ctx context.Context, request GetPetsRequestObject) (GetPetsResponseObject, error) {\n    var result []Pet\n\t// Implement me\n    return GetPets200JSONResponse(result), nil\n}\n```\n\nFor a complete example see [`examples/petstore-expanded/strict`](https://github.com/deepmap/oapi-codegen/tree/master/examples/petstore-expanded/strict).\n\nCode is generated with a configuration flag `generate: strict-server: true` along with any other server (echo, chi, gin and gorilla are supported).\nThe generated strict wrapper can then be used as an implementation for `ServerInterface`. Setup example:\n\n```go\nfunc SetupHandler() {\n    var myApi PetStoreImpl\n\tmyStrictApiHandler := api.NewStrictHandler(myApi, nil)\n    e := echo.New()\n    petstore.RegisterHandlers(e, &myStrictApiHandler)\n}\n```\n\nStrict server also has its own middlewares. It can access to both request and response structs,\nas well as raw request\\response data. It can be used for logging the parsed request\\response objects, transforming go errors into response structs,\nauthorization, etc. Note that middlewares are server-specific.\n\n#### Additional Properties in type definitions\n\n[OpenAPI Schemas](https://swagger.io/specification/#schemaObject) implicitly\naccept `additionalProperties`, meaning that any fields provided, but not explicitly\ndefined via properties on the schema are accepted as input, and propagated. When\nunspecified, the `additionalProperties` field is assumed to be `true`.\n\nAdditional properties are tricky to support in Go with typing, and require\nlots of boilerplate code, so in this library, we assume that `additionalProperties`\ndefaults to `false` and we don't generate this boilerplate. If you would like\nan object to accept `additionalProperties`, specify a schema for `additionalProperties`.\n\nSay we declared `NewPet` above like so:\n\n```yaml\nNewPet:\n  required:\n    - name\n  properties:\n    name:\n      type: string\n    tag:\n      type: string\n  additionalProperties:\n    type: string\n```\n\nThe Go code for `NewPet` would now look like this:\n\n```go\n// NewPet defines model for NewPet.\ntype NewPet struct {\n\tName                 string            `json:\"name\"`\n\tTag                  *string           `json:\"tag,omitempty\"`\n\tAdditionalProperties map[string]string `json:\"-\"`\n}\n```\n\nThe additionalProperties, of type `string` become `map[string]string`, which maps\nfield names to instances of the `additionalProperties` schema.\n\n```go\n// Getter for additional properties for NewPet. Returns the specified\n// element and whether it was found\nfunc (a NewPet) Get(fieldName string) (value string, found bool) {...}\n\n// Setter for additional properties for NewPet\nfunc (a *NewPet) Set(fieldName string, value string) {...}\n\n// Override default JSON handling for NewPet to handle additionalProperties\nfunc (a *NewPet) UnmarshalJSON(b []byte) error {...}\n\n// Override default JSON handling for NewPet to handle additionalProperties\nfunc (a NewPet) MarshalJSON() ([]byte, error) {...}w\n```\n\nThere are many special cases for `additionalProperties`, such as having to\ndefine types for inner fields which themselves support additionalProperties, and\nall of them are tested via the [`internal/test/components`](https://github.com/deepmap/oapi-codegen/tree/master/internal/test/components) schemas and tests. Please\nlook through those tests for more usage examples.\n\n#### oneOf/anyOf/allOf support\n\n- `oneOf` and `anyOf` are implemented using delayed parsing with the help of `json.RawMessage`.\n  The following schema will result in a type that has methods such as `AsCat`, `AsDog`, `FromCat`, `FromDog`, `MergeCat`, `MergeDog`. If the schema also includes a discriminator the generated code will also have methods such as `Discriminator`, `ValueByDiscriminator` and will force discriminator value in `From` methods.\n\n```yaml\nschema:\n  oneOf:\n    - $ref: '#/components/schemas/Cat'\n    - $ref: '#/components/schemas/Dog'\n```\n\n- `allOf` is supported, by taking the union of all the fields in all the\n  component schemas. This is the most useful of these operations, and is\n  commonly used to merge objects with an identifier, as in the\n  `petstore-expanded` example.\n\n## Generated Client Boilerplate\n\nOnce your server is up and running, you probably want to make requests to it. If\nyou're going to do those requests from your Go code, we also generate a client\nwhich is conformant with your schema to help in marshaling objects to JSON. It\nuses the same types and similar function signatures to your request handlers.\n\nThe interface for the pet store looks like this:\n\n```go\n// The interface specification for the client above.\ntype ClientInterface interface {\n\n\t// FindPets request\n\tFindPets(ctx context.Context, params *FindPetsParams, reqEditors ...RequestEditorFn) (*http.Response, error)\n\n\t// AddPet request with JSON body\n\tAddPet(ctx context.Context, body NewPet, reqEditors ...RequestEditorFn) (*http.Response, error)\n\n\t// DeletePet request\n\tDeletePet(ctx context.Context, id int64, reqEditors ...RequestEditorFn) (*http.Response, error)\n\n\t// FindPetById request\n\tFindPetById(ctx context.Context, id int64, reqEditors ...RequestEditorFn) (*http.Response, error)\n}\n```\n\nA Client object which implements the above interface is also generated:\n\n```go\n// Client which conforms to the OpenAPI3 specification for this service.\ntype Client struct {\n    // The endpoint of the server conforming to this interface, with scheme,\n    // https://api.deepmap.com for example.\n    Server string\n\n    // HTTP client with any customized settings, such as certificate chains.\n    Client http.Client\n\n    // A callback for modifying requests which are generated before sending over\n    // the network.\n    RequestEditors []func(ctx context.Context, req *http.Request) error\n}\n```\n\nEach operation in your OpenAPI spec will result in a client function which\ntakes the same arguments. It's difficult to handle any arbitrary body that\nSwagger supports, so we've done some special casing for bodies, and you may get\nmore than one function for an operation with a request body.\n\n1.  If you have more than one request body type, meaning more than one media\n    type, you will have a generic handler of this form:\n\n           AddPet(ctx context.Context, contentType string, body io.Reader)\n\n2.  If you have only a JSON request body, you will get:\n\n         AddPet(ctx context.Context, body NewPet)\n\n3.  If you have multiple request body types, which include a JSON type you will\n    get two functions. We've chosen to give the JSON version a shorter name, as\n    we work with JSON and don't want to wear out our keyboards.\n\n           AddPet(ctx context.Context, body NewPet)\n           AddPetWithBody(ctx context.Context, contentType string, body io.Reader)\n\nThe Client object above is fairly flexible, since you can pass in your own\n`http.Client` and a request editing callback. You can use that callback to add\nheaders. In our middleware stack, we annotate the context with additional\ninformation such as the request ID and function tracing information, and we\nuse the callback to propagate that information into the request headers. Still, we\ncan't foresee all possible usages, so those functions call through to helper\nfunctions which create requests. In the case of the pet store, we have:\n\n```go\n// Request generator for FindPets\nfunc NewFindPetsRequest(server string, params *FindPetsParams) (*http.Request, error) {...}\n\n// Request generator for AddPet with JSON body\nfunc NewAddPetRequest(server string, body NewPet) (*http.Request, error) {...}\n\n// Request generator for AddPet with non-JSON body\nfunc NewAddPetRequestWithBody(server string, contentType string, body io.Reader) (*http.Request, error) {...}\n\n// Request generator for DeletePet\nfunc NewDeletePetRequest(server string, id int64) (*http.Request, error) {...}\n\n// Request generator for FindPetById\nfunc NewFindPetByIdRequest(server string, id int64) (*http.Request, error) {...}\n```\n\nYou can call these functions to build an `http.Request` from Go objects, which\nwill correspond to your request schema. They map one-to-one to the functions on\nthe client, except that we always generate the generic non-JSON body handler.\n\nThere are some caveats to using this code.\n\n- exploded, form style query arguments, which are the default argument format\n  in OpenAPI 3.0 are undecidable. Say that I have two objects, one composed of\n  the fields `(name=bob, id=5)` and another which has `(name=shoe, color=brown)`.\n  The first parameter is named `person` and the second is named `item`. The\n  default marshaling style for query args would result in\n  `/path/?name=bob,id=5&name=shoe,color=brown`. In order to tell what belongs\n  to which object, we'd have to look at all the parameters and try to deduce it,\n  but we're lazy, so we didn't. Don't use exploded form style arguments if\n  you're passing around objects which have similar field names. If you\n  used unexploded form parameters, you'd have\n  `/path/?person=name,bob,id,5&item=name,shoe,color,brown`, which an be\n  parsed unambiguously.\n\n- Parameters can be defined via `schema` or via `content`. Use the `content` form\n  for anything other than trivial objects, they can marshal to arbitrary JSON\n  structures. When you send them as cookie (`in: cookie`) arguments, we will\n  URL encode them, since JSON delimiters aren't allowed in cookies.\n\n## Using SecurityProviders\n\nIf you generate client-code, you can use some default-provided security providers\nwhich help you to use the various OpenAPI 3 Authentication mechanism.\n\n```go\n    import (\n        \"github.com/deepmap/oapi-codegen/pkg/securityprovider\"\n    )\n\n    func CreateSampleProviders() error {\n        // Example BasicAuth\n        // See: https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/basic-authentication/\n        basicAuthProvider, basicAuthProviderErr := securityprovider.NewSecurityProviderBasicAuth(\"MY_USER\", \"MY_PASS\")\n        if basicAuthProviderErr != nil {\n            panic(basicAuthProviderErr)\n        }\n\n        // Example BearerToken\n        // See: https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/bearer-authentication/\n        bearerTokenProvider, bearerTokenProviderErr := securityprovider.NewSecurityProviderBearerToken(\"MY_TOKEN\")\n        if bearerTokenProviderErr != nil {\n            panic(bearerTokenProviderErr)\n        }\n\n        // Example ApiKey provider\n        // See: https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/api-keys/\n        apiKeyProvider, apiKeyProviderErr := securityprovider.NewSecurityProviderApiKey(\"query\", \"myApiKeyParam\", \"MY_API_KEY\")\n        if apiKeyProviderErr != nil {\n            panic(apiKeyProviderErr)\n        }\n\n        // Example providing your own provider using an anonymous function wrapping in the\n        // InterceptoFn adapter. The behaviour between the InterceptorFn and the Interceptor interface\n        // are the same as http.HandlerFunc and http.Handler.\n        customProvider := func(req *http.Request, ctx context.Context) error {\n            // Just log the request header, nothing else.\n            log.Println(req.Header)\n            return nil\n        }\n\n        // Exhaustive list of some defaults you can use to initialize a Client.\n        // If you need to override the underlying httpClient, you can use the option\n        //\n        // WithHTTPClient(httpClient *http.Client)\n        //\n        client, clientErr := NewClient(\"https://api.deepmap.com\", WithRequestEditorFn(apiKeyProvider.Intercept))\n\n        return nil\n    }\n```\n\n## Extensions\n\n`oapi-codegen` supports the following extended properties:\n\n- `x-go-type`: specifies Go type name. It allows you to specify the type name for a schema, and\n  will override any default value. This extended property isn't supported in all parts of\n  OpenAPI, so please refer to the spec as to where it's allowed. Swagger validation tools will\n  flag incorrect usage of this property.\n- `x-go-type-skip-optional-pointer`: specifies if the Go type should or should not be a pointer\n  when the property is optional. If set to true, the type will not be a pointer if the field is\n  optional or nullable. If set to false, the type will be a pointer.\n  \n  ```yaml\n  properties:\n    field:\n      type: string\n      x-go-type-skip-optional-pointer: true\n  ```\n  \n  In the example above, the `field` field will be of type `string` instead of `*string`. This is\n  useful when you want to handle the case of an empty string differently than a null value.\n  \n- `x-go-name`: specifies Go field name. It allows you to specify the field name for a schema, and\n  will override any default value. This extended property isn't supported in all parts of\n  OpenAPI, so please refer to the spec as to where it's allowed. Swagger validation tools will\n  flag incorrect usage of this property.\n- `x-go-type-name`: This property allows for assigning a Go type name to some part of a schema,\n  such as generating a type name for an anonymous object inside another object, or renaming\n  an enum. It differs from `x-go-type`, in that it doesn't completely replace some type reference,\n  but simply names it.\n- `x-go-json-ignore`: sets tag to `-` to ignore the field in json completely.\n- `x-oapi-codegen-extra-tags`: adds extra Go field tags to the generated struct field. This is\n  useful for interfacing with tag based ORM or validation libraries. The extra tags that\n  are added are in addition to the regular json tags that are generated. If you specify your\n  own `json` tag, you will override the default one.\n\n  ```yaml\n  components:\n    schemas:\n      Object:\n        properties:\n          name:\n            type: string\n            x-oapi-codegen-extra-tags:\n              tag1: value1\n              tag2: value2\n  ```\n\n  In the example above, field `name` will be declared as:\n\n  ```\n  Name string `json:\"name\" tag1:\"value1\" tag2:\"value2\"`\n  ```\n\n- `x-go-type-import`: adds extra Go imports to your generated code. It can help you, when you want to\n  choose your own import package for `x-go-type`.\n\n  ```yaml\n  schemas:\n    Pet:\n      properties:\n        age:\n          x-go-type: myuuid.UUID\n          x-go-type-import:\n            name: myuuid\n            path: github.com/google/uuid\n  ```\n\n  After code generation you will get this:\n\n  ```go\n    import (\n        ...\n        myuuid \"github.com/google/uuid\"\n    )\n\n  //Pet defines model for Pet.\n    type Pet struct {\n        Age *myuuid.UUID `json:\"age,omitempty\"`\n    }\n\n  ```\n\n  `name` is an optional parameter. Example:\n\n  ```yaml\n  components:\n  schemas:\n    Pet:\n      properties:\n        age:\n          x-go-type: uuid.UUID\n          x-go-type-import:\n            path: github.com/google/uuid\n      required:\n        - age\n  ```\n\n  After code generation you will get this result:\n\n  ```go\n  import (\n    \"github.com/google/uuid\"\n  )\n\n  // Pet defines model for Pet.\n  type Pet struct {\n    Age uuid.UUID `json:\"age\"`\n  }\n  ```\n\n- `x-enum-varnames`: supplies other enum names for the corresponding values. (alias: `x-enumNames`)\n\n  ```yaml\n  components:\n    schemas:\n      Object:\n        properties:\n          category:\n            type: integer\n            enum: [0, 1, 2]\n            x-enum-varnames:\n              - notice\n              - warning\n              - urgent\n  ```\n\n  After code generation you will get this result:\n\n  ```go\n  // Defines values for ObjectCategory.\n  const (\n  \tNotice  ObjectCategory = 0\n  \tUrgent  ObjectCategory = 2\n  \tWarning ObjectCategory = 1\n  )\n\n  // ObjectCategory defines model for Object.Category.\n  type ObjectCategory int\n  ```\n\n## Using `oapi-codegen`\n\nThe default options for `oapi-codegen` will generate everything; client, server,\ntype definitions and embedded swagger spec, but you can generate subsets of\nthose via the `-generate` flag. It defaults to `types,client,server,spec`, but\nyou can specify any combination of those.\n\n- `types`: generate all type definitions for all types in the OpenAPI spec. This\n  will be everything under `#components`, as well as request parameter, request\n  body, and response type objects.\n- `server`: generate the Echo server boilerplate. `server` requires the types in the\n  same package to compile.\n- `chi-server`: generate the Chi server boilerplate. This code is dependent on\n  that produced by the `types` target.\n- `fiber`: generate the Fiber server boilerplate. This code is dependent\n  on that produced by the `types` target.\n- `iris`: generate the Iris server boilerplate. This code is dependent\n  on that produced by the `types` target.\n- `client`: generate the client boilerplate. It, too, requires the types to be\n  present in its package.\n- `spec`: embed the OpenAPI spec into the generated code as a gzipped blob.\n  This is then usable with the `OapiRequestValidator`, or to be used by other\n  methods that need access to the parsed OpenAPI specification\n- `skip-fmt`: skip running `goimports` on the generated code. This is useful for debugging\n  the generated file in case the spec contains weird strings.\n- `skip-prune`: skip pruning unused components from the spec prior to generating\n  the code.\n- `import-mapping`: specifies a map of references external OpenAPI specs to go\n  Go include paths. Please see below.\n\nSo, for example, if you would like to produce only the server code, you could\nrun `oapi-codegen -generate types,server`. You could generate `types` and\n`server` into separate files, but both are required for the server code.\n\n`oapi-codegen` can filter paths base on their tags in the openapi definition.\nUse either `-include-tags` or `-exclude-tags` followed by a comma-separated list\nof tags. For instance, to generate a server that serves all paths except those\ntagged with `auth` or `admin`, use the argument, `-exclude-tags=\"auth,admin\"`.\nTo generate a server that only handles `admin` paths, use the argument\n`-include-tags=\"admin\"`. When neither of these arguments is present, all paths\nare generated.\n\n`oapi-codegen` can filter schemas based on the option `--exclude-schemas`, which is\na comma separated list of schema names. For instance, `--exclude-schemas=Pet,NewPet`\nwill exclude from generation schemas `Pet` and `NewPet`. This allow to have a\nin the same package a manually defined structure or interface and refer to it\nin the openapi spec.\n\nSince `go generate` commands must be a single line, all the options above can make\nthem pretty unwieldy, so you can specify all of the options in a configuration\nfile via the `--config` option. Please see the test under\n[`/internal/test/externalref/`](https://github.com/deepmap/oapi-codegen/blob/master/internal/test/externalref/externalref.cfg.yaml)\nfor an example. The structure of the file is as follows:\n\n```yaml\npackage: externalref\ngenerate:\n  models: true\n  embedded-spec: true\nimport-mapping:\n  ./packageA/spec.yaml: github.com/deepmap/oapi-codegen/internal/test/externalref/packageA\n  ./packageB/spec.yaml: github.com/deepmap/oapi-codegen/internal/test/externalref/packageB\noutput: externalref.gen.go\noutput-options:\n  skip-prune: true\n```\n\nHave a look at [`cmd/oapi-codegen/oapi-codegen.go`](https://github.com/deepmap/oapi-codegen/blob/master/cmd/oapi-codegen/oapi-codegen.go#L48)\nto see all the fields on the configuration structure.\n\n### Import Mappings\n\nOpenAPI specifications may contain references to other OpenAPI specifications,\nand we need some additional information in order to be able to generate correct\nGo code.\n\nAn external reference looks like this:\n\n    $ref: ./some_spec.yaml#/components/schemas/Type\n\nWe assume that you have already generated the boilerplate code for `./some_spec.yaml`\nusing `oapi-codegen`, and you have a package which contains the generated code,\nlet's call it `github.com/deepmap/some-package`. You need to tell `oapi-codegen` that\n`some_spec.yaml` corresponds to this package, and you would do it by specifying\nthis command line argument:\n\n    -import-mapping=./some_spec.yaml:github.com/deepmap/some-package\n\nThis tells us that in order to resolve references generated from `some_spec.yaml` we\nneed to import `github.com/deepmap/some-package`. You may specify multiple mappings\nby comma separating them in the form `key1:value1,key2:value2`.\n\n## What's missing or incomplete\n\nThis code is still young, and not complete, since we're filling it in as we\nneed it. We've not yet implemented several things:\n\n- `patternProperties` isn't yet supported and will exit with an error. Pattern\n  properties were defined in JSONSchema, and the `kin-openapi` Swagger object\n  knows how to parse them, but they're not part of OpenAPI 3.0, so we've left\n  them out, as support is very complicated.\n\n## Making changes to code generation\n\nThe code generator uses a tool to inline all the template definitions into\ncode, so that we don't have to deal with the location of the template files.\nWhen you update any of the files under the `templates/` directory, you will\nneed to regenerate the template inlines:\n\n    go generate ./pkg/codegen/templates\n\nAll this command does is inline the files ending in `.tmpl` into the specified\nGo file.\n\nAfterwards you should run `go generate ./...`, and the templates will be updated\naccordingly.\n\nAlternatively, you can provide custom templates to override built-in ones using\nthe `-templates` flag specifying a path to a directory containing templates\nfiles. These files **must** be named identically to built-in template files\n(see `pkg/codegen/templates/*.tmpl` in the source code), and will be interpreted\non-the-fly at run time. Example:\n\n    $ ls -1 my-templates/\n    client.tmpl\n    typedef.tmpl\n    $ oapi-codegen \\\n        -templates my-templates/ \\\n        -generate types,client \\\n        petstore-expanded.yaml\n\nWhen using the configuration file, it is possible to provide templates directly\nas text, as a local path, or as a URL. If the data provided to the\nconfiguration file is more than one line, the local path and URL checks will be\nignored and will be treated as raw template text. If one line, the string\nwill be used to check for a local file, followed by checking performing a HTTP\nGET request. If the file lookup returns any error other than not found, or the\nHTTP request returns a non 200 response code, the generator will error.\n\n⚠️ Warning: If using urls that tracks against git repositories such as\n`raw.githubusercontent.com`, it is strongly encouraged to use a tag or a hash\ninstead of a branch like `main`. Tracking a branch can lead to unexpected API\ndrift, and loss of the ability to reproduce a build.\n\nExamples:\n\n```yaml\noutput: api.gen.go\npackage: api\noutput-options:\n  user-templates:\n    # using a local file\n    client-with-responses.tmpl: /home/username/workspace/templatesProject/my-client-with-responses.tmpl\n\n    # The following are referencing a versuion of the default\n    # client-with-responses.tmpl file, but loaded in through\n    # github's raw.githubusercontent.com. The general form\n    # to use raw.githubusercontent.com is as follows\n    # https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<username>/<project>/<hash|tag|branch>/path/to/template/template.tmpl\n\n    # using raw.githubusercontent.com with a hash\n    client-with-responses.tmpl: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deepmap/oapi-codegen/7b010099dcf1192b3bfaa3898b5f375bb9590ddf/pkg/codegen/templates/client-with-responses.tmpl\n    # using raw.githubusercontent.com with a tag\n    client-with-responses.tmpl: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deepmap/oapi-codegen/v1.12.4/pkg/codegen/templates/client-with-responses.tmpl\n    # using raw.githubusercontent.com with a branch\n    client-with-responses.tmpl: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deepmap/oapi-codegen/master/pkg/codegen/templates/client-with-responses.tmpl\n\n    #This example is directly embedding the template into the config file.\n    client-with-responses.tmpl: |\n        // ClientWithResponses builds on ClientInterface to offer response payloads\n        type ClientWithResponses struct {\n            ClientInterface\n        }\n        ...\n    # template shortened for brevity\n\n```\n\nUsing the configuration file to load in templates **will** load in templates\nwith names other than those defined by the built in templates. These user\ntemplates will not be called unless the user overrides a built in template to\ncall them however.\n"

  # OpenAPI Snippet

  **Generates code snippets from Open API (previously Swagger) documents.**


  This package takes as input an OpenAPI v2.0 or v3.0.x document. It translates
  the document into an [HTTP Archive 1.2 request
  object](http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/har-12-spec/#request). It uses the
  [HTTP Snippet](https://github.com/Mashape/httpsnippet) library to generate
  code snippets for every API endpoint (URL path + HTTP method) defined in the
  specification in various languages & tools (`cURL`, `Node`, `Python`, `Ruby`,
  `Java`, `Go`, `C#`...), or for selected endpoints.


  ## Installation


  ```bash

  npm i openapi-snippet

  ```


  ## Build OpenAPI Snippet (for use in browser)

  Clone this repository. Install required dependencies:


  ```bash

  npm i

  ```


  Build a minified version of OpenAPI Snippet (`openapisnippet.min.js`):


  ```bash

  npm run build

  ```


  ## Usage


  ### As a module


  ```javascript

  const OpenAPISnippet = require('openapi-snippet')


  // define input:

  const openApi = ... // Open API document

  const targets = ['node_unirest', 'c'] // array of targets for code snippets.
  See list below...


  try {
    // either, get snippets for ALL endpoints:
    const results = OpenAPISnippet.getSnippets(openApi, targets) // results is now array of snippets, see "Output" below.

    // ...or, get snippets for a single endpoint:
    const results2 = OpenAPISnippet.getEndpointSnippets(openApi, '/users/{user-id}/relationship', 'get', targets)
  } catch (err) {
    // do something with potential errors...
  }

  ```


  ### Within the browser


  Include the `openapisnippet.min.js` file created after building the the
  library (see above) in your HTML page:


  ```html

  <script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/openapisnippet.min.js"></script>

  ```


  Use OpenAPI Snippet, which now defines the global variable `OpenAPISnippet`.



  ## Output

  The output for every endpoint is an object, containing the `method`, `url`, a
  human-readable `description`, and the corresponding `resource` - all of these
  values stem from the OpenAPI document. In addition, within the `snippets`
  list, an object containing a code snippet for every chosen target is provided.
  As of version `0.4.0`, the snippets include exemplary payload data.


  If `getSnippets` is used, an array of the above described objects is returned.


  For example:


  ```js

  [
    // ...
    {
      "method": "GET",
      "url": "https://api.instagram.com/v1/users/{user-id}/relationship",
      "description": "Get information about a relationship to another user.",
      "resource": "relationship",
      "snippets": [
        {
          "id": "node",
          "title": "Node + Native",
          "content": "var http = require(\"https\");\n\nvar options = {..."
        }
      ]
    }
    // ...
  ]

  ```


  ## Targets

  Currently, OpenAPI Snippet supports the following targets (depending on the
  HTTP Snippet library):


  * `c_libcurl` (default)

  * `csharp_restsharp` (default)

  * `go_native` (default)

  * `java_okhttp`

  * `java_unirest` (default)

  * `javascript_jquery`

  * `javascript_xhr` (default)

  * `node_native` (default)

  * `node_request`

  * `node_unirest`

  * `objc_nsurlsession` (default)

  * `ocaml_cohttp` (default)

  * `php_curl` (default)

  * `php_http1`

  * `php_http2`

  * `python_python3` (default)

  * `python_requests`

  * `ruby_native` (default)

  * `shell_curl` (default)

  * `shell_httpie`

  * `shell_wget`

  * `swift_nsurlsession` (default)


  If only the language is provided (e.g., `c`), the default library will be
  selected.

  # OpenAPI extension for Visual Studio Code


  This [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VS Code)
  [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=42Crunch.vscode-openapi)
  adds rich support for the [OpenAPI
  Specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) (OAS) (formerly
  known as Swagger Specification) in JSON or YAML format. The features include,
  for example, SwaggerUI and ReDoc preview, IntelliSense, linting, schema
  enforcement, code navigation, definition links, snippets, static security
  analysis, and more!


  The extension also integrates with [API Contract Security
  Audit](https://docs.42crunch.com/latest/content/concepts/api_contract_security_audit.htm)
  by 42Crunch, so that you can check the quality of your API definition directly
  in VS Code.


  Both OAS v2 and v3 are supported.

  ## Quick start


  After installing the plugin, open any JSON or YAML file that contains an
  OpenAPI definition in VS Code. The plugin automatically detects that this is
  an OpenAPI file, and the OpenAPI button <img
  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/42Crunch/vscode-openapi/master/images/OpenAPI%20button.PNG"
  width=20 height=19> is shown in the left-hand panel.


  ![OpenAPI Explorer](images/OpenAPI%20Explorer.PNG)


  ## Use the extension while editing your API


  OpenAPI extension makes it easier and faster to navigate your OpenAPI
  definitions, especially when they get longer.


  You can home in on elements in the OpenAPI explorer view, or jump directly to
  the target of a reference in the API. You can also add new elements to your
  API directly in the OpenAPI explorer directly where they are needed. Filling
  in the details is quicker with IntelliSense support for OpenAPI elements.


  ### Create new OpenAPI files


  1. Press **Ctrl+Shift+P** on Windows or Linux, or **Cmd+Shift+P** on a Mac.

  2. In the command prompt, start typing `new openapi`, and click the
  corresponding command to create either an OAS v2 or v3 template file.

  3. Use the OpenAPI explorer to populate the template with new paths and other
  elements as needed.

  4. Save the file to your disk to fully enable IntelliSense.


  ![Create new OpenAPI file from a
  template](https://github.com/42Crunch/vscode-openapi/blob/master/images/New%20OpenAPI%20file.gif?raw=true)


  ### Navigate API definition


  1. Open an OpenAPI file.

  2. Click the OpenAPI button to switch to the OpenAPI explorer view.

  3. Expand the sections and elements in the file as needed, and click the ones
  you want to jump to in the editor.


  ![Navigation inside the OpenAPI
  file](https://github.com/42Crunch/vscode-openapi/blob/master/images/Naviation.gif?raw=true)


  ### Add new elements in the OpenAPI explorer


  1. In OpenAPI explorer pane, go to the section where you want to add a new
  element, and click the **...** menu.

  2. Click the item you want to add from the dropdown list.


  ![Add new API path and
  verb](https://github.com/42Crunch/vscode-openapi/blob/master/images/Add%20paths%20and%20verbs.gif?raw=true)


  ### Use IntelliSense


  As you start typing OpenAPI elements or their values, the context-sensitive
  list of available options is displayed in the IntelliSense menu. In JSON
  OpenAPI files, just type double-quote (`"`) to show the menu, and type further
  to filter the list. In YAML OpenAPI files, start typing the property name.


  You can also use the corresponding VS Code hotkey (**Ctrl+Space** on Windows,
  **Cmd+Space** on Mac) to open the IntelliSense menu.


  ![IntelliSense for OpenAPI
  editing](https://github.com/42Crunch/vscode-openapi/blob/master/images/Intellisense.gif?raw=true)


  ### Jump to a reference


  Use Go to Definition to locate the targets of references easily. To jump to
  view the definition from a reference in your API, either **Ctrl+click** a
  reference, or right-click a reference and click **Go to Definition** in the
  shortcut menu.


  ![Go to
  definition](https://github.com/42Crunch/vscode-openapi/blob/master/images/Go%20to%20Definition.gif?raw=true)


  ### Sort entries in the navigation pane


  By default, entries in the OpenAPI Explorer pane are sorted alphabetically. If
  you want to instead have them sorted in the order they are in the OpenAPI
  file, change the corresponding setting:


  1. On the **File** menu, click **Preferences > Settings**.

  2. Expand the **Extensions** section and click **OpenAPI**.

  3. Clear the checkbox **Alphabetically sort contents of OpenAPI explorer
  outlines**.


  ### Preview OpenAPI documentation


  You can get a documentation-style preview of the API you are editing by
  clicking the Preview button <img src="images/Preview_button.png" width=19 />
  at the top right:


  ![OpenAPI Preview Pane](images/OpenAPI_preview_pane.gif)


  Our extension supports two popular OpenAPI documentation generators:
  [SwaggerUI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) and
  [ReDoc](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc).


  To change the default OpenAPI Preview rendering engine:


  1. On the **File** menu, click **Preferences > Settings**.

  2. Expand the **Extensions** section and click **OpenAPI**.

  3. Pick the option of your choice from the **Default Preview Rendered**
  dropdown list.


  ![OpenAPI Preview Pane](images/Change_OpenAPI_Preview_engine.jpg)


  ### Execute operations with "Try it" (beta)


  With "Try it" you can invoke operations defined in your OpenAPI directly from
  VS Code.


  To do it click on "Try it" code lens which is displayed right below the HTTP
  verb ("get", "post", etc) of your operation and in the examples section.


  When using "Try it" from the examples, the value of the example will be used
  as the payload for the request. Otherwise payload will be generated based on
  the request JSON Schema, or the first example available.


  ![TryIt view](images/tryit.png)


  Try it is a new feature, and has number of limitations:


  - Only OpenAPI 3.x is supported. Try it is not available in Swagger/OpenAPI
  2.0 files.

  - Sending files is not supported

  - Try it works best with small textual responses, such as JSON. Binary/image
  responses will be shown as text


  ### Generate JSON Schema using based on the response content


  "Try it" can be used to generate JSON Schema based on the body of the
  response. To do it, select

  "Tools" tab in the TryIt response view and click "Generate schema" button.


  ![TryIt response tools](images/tryit-schema.png)


  ## Use the extension to audit the security of your API


  You can use OpenAPI extension to check the quality of your API as you work on
  it. You can run the audit directly from VS Code by clicking the **42C** button
  in the upper right corner.


  To run Security Audit from VS Code, you need a token. On the first time, you
  are asked to provide your email address. When you supply the address, the
  extension requests the token to be sent to your mailbox. Once you get the
  token, paste it in the prompt in VS Code, and you are all set. From now on,
  all you need to do is to click the button to run the audit.


  ### Navigate the issues in the audit report


  After the audit finishes, you get the audit report directly in the VS Code
  view, side by side with your code. Depending on your API definition, the
  report might be long, so here are some handy ways to navigate the found
  issues.


  1. To scroll through all issues and their details, use the text panel on the
  right.


  ![Perform REST API Security
  Audit](https://github.com/42Crunch/vscode-openapi/blob/master/images/Perform%20REST%20API%20Security%20Audit.gif?raw=true)


  2. Hover on an element that is underlined or marked with three dots
  (recommendations) in your code to see what the issues in that spot are. If you
  click on view the descriptions of only these issues, the rest of details are
  filtered out from the text panel, so you have less to scroll through.


  ![Details for specific
  issues](https://github.com/42Crunch/vscode-openapi/blob/master/images/Details%20for%20specific%20issues.gif?raw=true)


  3. For a quick overall look, check the counts in the Status Bar. The different
  icons match the severity of the issue:


  - Error: critical or high

  - Warning: medium

  - Info: low


  ![List of API Sec
  Issues](https://github.com/42Crunch/vscode-openapi/blob/master/images/List%20of%20API%20Sec%20Issues.gif?raw=true)


  4. Click the icons in the Status Bar to open the PROBLEMS panel and scroll
  through the issue titles. The issues are ordered from most to least severe, so
  it is easy for fix the worst offenders first. Note that recommendations are
  not listed in the PROBLEMS panel.

  5. Click on an issue in the PROBLEMS panel to jump to view it inline in your
  API definition.


  ### Fix issues


  Many of the issues reported by the Security Audit have Fixes associated with
  them. These are code snippets that you can get inserted into the OpenAPI file
  and then customize with the appropriate value.


  #### Individual fixes


  1. Perform the Security Audit by clicking the **42c** button.

  2. When you click some of the error lines in your OpenAPI file, you will see
  the QuickFix icon show up on the left of the line.

  3. Click the icon and select the QuickFix to apply.

  4. Tweak the values in the inserted code snippet as you see fit.

  #### Bulk fixes


  If your OpenAPI file contains multiple similar issues - for example, a
  parameter with the same name is missing the pattern definition - you can fix
  all such occurrences in one go:


  1. Fix the first occurrence and supply the proper values in the code snippet.

  2. Go to the next occurrence and use the bulk QuickFix. This bulk QuickFix
  will reuse the values that you used previously for the parameter with the same
  name.

  ## Miscellaneous commands


  - You can load results of Security Audit from a file for a currently open
  OpenAPI file by running command `42Crunch: Load Security Audit report from
  file` from the command palette


  ## Integration with 42Crunch Platform


  This extension features optional integration with [42Crunch
  Platform](https://platform.42crunch.com/). To enable it please configure your
  credentials by running `42Crunch: Update platform credentials` command from
  the command palette.


  ## Known issues


  - For new files, IntelliSense does not work until you save the file. File
  extension must be `.json` or `.yaml`.

  - When running 42 Crunch Conformance Scan on a host with incorrect clock, the
  scan can fail with the message `cannot send the scan report : rpc error: code
  = InvalidArgument desc = invalid input`, to resolve the issue make sure your
  clock is correctly set.

  applied when the application starts. You can trigger manually with `alembic
  upgrade head`.

  5. Run:
      - FastAPI Application:
          * _For Active Development (w/ auto-reload):_ Run locally with `pipenv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload `
          * _For Debugging (compatible w/ debuggers, no auto-reload):_ Configure debugger to run `python app/main.py`.
      - Background Task Worker:
          * _For Active Development:_ Run with `pipenv run arq app.worker.Worker --watch ./`

  ### Run Locally with Docker-Compose

  1. Clone this Repository. `git clone
  https://github.com/leosussan/fastapi-gino-arq-uvicorn.git`

  2. Generate a DB Migration: `alembic revision --autogenerate`.*

  3. Run locally using docker-compose. `docker-compose -f
  docker-compose.local.yml -f docker-compose.worker.yml -f docker-compose.yml up
  --build`.


  *`app/settings/prestart.sh` will run migrations for you before the app starts.


  ### Build Your Application

  * Create routes in `/app/routes`, import & add them to the `ROUTERS` constant
  in  `/app/main.py`

  * Create database models to `/app/models/orm`, add them to
  `/app/models/orm/migrations/env.py` for migrations

  * Create pydantic models in `/app/models/pydantic`

  * Store complex db queries in `/app/models/orm/queries`

  * Store complex tasks in `app/tasks`.

  * Add / edit globals to `/.env`, expose & import them from
  `/app/settings/globals.py`
      * Use any coroutine as a background function: store a reference in the `ARQ_BACKGROUND_FUNCTIONS` env.
      * Set `SENTRY_DSN` in your environment to enable Sentry.
  * Define code to run before launch (migrations, setup, etc) in
  `/app/settings/prestart.sh`

    * Got a question? Need some guidance? Start a [discussion](https://github.com/Cornutum/tcases/discussions).

  ## What Does It Do? ##


  Tcases is a tool for designing tests. It doesn't matter what kind of system
  you are testing -- UI, command line,

  [REST-ful
  API](tcases-openapi/README.md#tcases-for-openapi-from-rest-ful-to-test-ful),
  or backend.  Nor does it matter

  what level of the system you are testing -- unit, subsystem, or full system.
  You can use Tcases to design your tests in any of

  these situations. With Tcases, you define the input space for your
  system-under-test and the level of coverage that you

  want. Then Tcases generates a minimal set of test cases that meets your
  requirements.


  Tcases is primarily a tool for black-box test design. For such tests, the
  concept of "coverage" is different from structural

  testing criteria such as line coverage, branch coverage, etc. Instead, Tcases
  is guided by coverage of the input space of your

  system.


  Tcases gives you a way to define the input space for your system in a form
  that is concise but comprehensive. Then Tcases allows

  you to control the number of test cases in your sample subset by specifying
  the level of coverage you want. You can start with a

  basic level of coverage, and Tcases will generate a small set of test cases
  that touches every significant element of the input

  space. Then you can improve your tests by selectively adding coverage in
  specific high-risk areas. For example, you can specify

  pairwise coverage or higher-order combinations of selected input variables.


  ## How Does It Work? ##


  First, you create a system input definition, a document that defines your
  system as a set of functions. For each system

  function, the system input definition defines the variables that characterize
  the function input space. If you are testing a Web

  service API, you can even [generate a system input definition
  automatically](tcases-openapi/README.md#tcases-for-openapi-from-rest-ful-to-test-ful)

  from an OpenAPI definition.


  Then, you can create a generator definition. That's another document that
  defines the coverage you want for each system

  function. The generator definition is optional. You can skip this step and
  still get a basic level of coverage.


  Finally, you run Tcases. Tcases is a Java program that you can run from the
  command line or using the

  [Tcases Maven
  Plugin](http://www.cornutum.org/tcases/docs/tcases-maven-plugin/). The command
  line version of Tcases comes with built-in

  support for running using a shell script or an ant target. Using your input
  definition and your generator definition, Tcases

  generates a system test definition. The system test definition is a document
  that lists, for each system function, a set of test

  cases that provides the specified level of coverage. Each test case defines a
  specific value for every function input

  variable. Tcases generates not only valid input values that define successful
  test cases but also invalid values for the tests

  cases that are needed to verify expected error handling.


  Of course, the system test definition is not something you can execute
  directly. (Unless it was

  [derived automatically from an OpenAPI
  definition](tcases-openapi/README.md#how-do-you-run-generated-api-test-cases)!)

  But it follows a well-defined schema, which means you can use a variety of
  transformation tools to convert it into a form that

  is suitable for testing your system. For example, Tcases comes with a built-in
  transformer that converts a system test

  definition into a Java source code template for a JUnit or TestNG test class.

  A Common Lisp library for handling Web API specifications. This allows to
  validate and parse HTTP request headers, parameters and bodies with OpenAPI3
  specification.


  ## Warning


  This software is still ALPHA quality. The APIs will be likely to change.


  ## Prerequisite


  * [libyaml](http://pyyaml.org/wiki/LibYAML) for loading OpenAPI spec files.


  ## Usage


  ### Loading specification file


  ```common-lisp

  (defvar *spec*
    (apispec:load-from-file #P"docs/api.yaml"))

  (apispec:spec-version *spec*)

  ;=> "3.0.2"

  ```


  ### Getting the operation


  ```common-lisp

  (defvar *router* (apispec:spec-router *spec*))


  (apispec:find-route *router* :GET "/users/12")

  ;=> #<APISPEC/CLASSES/OPERATION:OPERATION {1003DDB073}>

  ```


  ### Parsing and Validating HTTP requests


  ```common-lisp

  (import '(lack.request:request-query-parameters
            lack.request:request-body-parameters
            lack.request:request-cookies
            apispec:request-path-parameters))

  ;; Clack application

  (defvar *app*
    (lambda (env)
      (multiple-value-bind (operation path-parameters)
          (apispec:find-route (spec-router *spec*)
                              (getf env :request-method)
                              (getf env :path-info))
        ;; Getting Lack.Request
        (let ((request (apispec:validate-request operation env
                                                 :path-parameters path-parameters)))
          ;; Write the main application here.

          ;; Accessors for getting each parameters.
          (request-query-parameters request)  ;=> Query parameters (alist)
          (request-body-parameters request)   ;=> Body parameters (alist)
          (request-path-parameters request)   ;=> Path parameters (alist)
          (request-cookies)                   ;=> Cookie parameters (alist)

          ))))

  ;; Start the server

  (clack:clackup *app*)

  ```


  ### Validating and Encoding HTTP responses


  ```common-lisp

  (import 'lack.response:make-response)


  (apispec:validate-response operation
                             (make-response 200
                                            '(:content-type "application/json")
                                            '(("id" . 3)
                                              ("name" . "初音ミク")
                                              ("is_admin" . nil))))
  ;=> (200 (:CONTENT-TYPE "application/json")
  ("{\"id\":3,\"name\":\"初音ミク\",\"is_admin\":false}"))

  ```


  ### Custom Encoder for standard objects


  ```common-lisp

  (import 'lack.response:make-response)


  ;; Custom class

  (defclass user ()
    ((id :initarg :id)
     (name :initarg :name)
     (is-admin :initarg :is-admin)))

  ;; Define APISPEC:ENCODE-OBJECT for the class

  (defmethod apispec:encode-object ((user user))
    `(("id" . ,(slot-value user 'id))
      ("name" . ,(slot-value user 'name))
      ("is_admin" . ,(slot-value user 'is-admin))))

  (defvar *yukari*
    (make-instance 'user
                   :id 14
                   :name "結月ゆかり"
                   :is-admin nil))

  (apispec:validate-response operation
                             (make-response 200
                                            '(:content-type "application/json")
                                            *yukari*))
  ;=> (200 (:CONTENT-TYPE "application/json")
  ("{\"id\":14,\"name\":\"結月ゆかり\",\"is_admin\":false}"))

  ```

  # Play API Refined


  A tiny library to generate OpenAPI  documentation and json schema based on
  Refined's case classes.



  ## Setup


  In order to use play-json-org.dgouyette.refined you need to add the following
  lines to your `build.sbt`:


  ```scala

  resolvers += Resolver.bintrayRepo("dgouyette", "maven")


  libraryDependencies += "org.dgouyette" %% "api-refiner" % "1.0.0-M1"

  ```


  ## Usage


  ### Play Json Refined  errors 


  To return json errors based on org.dgouyette.refined classes you must import :


  ````scala

  import org.org.dgouyette.json.RefinedRuntimeValidator._

  ````


  ### Json Schema generation


  ```scala


  case class CollectionStringNonEmpty(e : List[String] Refined NonEmpty)

  JsonSchema.asJsValue[CollectionStringNonEmpty] // =>
  {"e":{"minLength":1,"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}}


  ```


  ### Json Schema on Client Error 


  ```scala

  case class LoginDTO(email  : String Refined NonEmpty, password : String
  Refined NonEmpty)



  @Singleton

  class HomeController @Inject()(bp: BodyParserWithJsonSchema) extends
  AbstractController(cc) {
    implicit val loginSchema = JsonSchema.asJsValue[LoginDTO]
    implicit val dtoSchema = JsonSchema.asJsValue[SimpleDTO]
    
    def login(): Action[LoginDTO] = Action(bp.jsonRefined(LoginDTO.fmt, loginSchema)) {
      implicit request =>
      Ok
    }
  }

  ``` 


  With a bad client request : 


  `curl -X POST http://localhost:9000/login -d '{"email" :"","password" :"" }'`


  You will have this error 


  ```json

  {
      "obj.email": [
          {
              "msg": [
                  "Predicate isEmpty() did not fail."
              ],
              "args": []
          }
      ],
      "_schema": {
          "password": {
              "minLength": 1,
              "type": "string"
          },
          "email": {
              "minLength": 1,
              "type": "string"
          }
      },
      "obj.password": [
          {
              "msg": [
                  "Predicate isEmpty() did not fail."
              ],
              "args": []
          }
      ]
  }

  ```


  ## Generate OpenAPI (Swagger) Documentation


  OpenAPIController : 

  ````scala

  def json: Action[Unit] = Action(parse.empty) {
      implicit  req =>
       Ok(OpenAPI.fromRoutesFile("conf/routes"))
    }
  ````


  conf/routes

  ```

  POST        /login                           controllers.HomeController.login

  GET         /doc/json                       
  controllers.OpenAPIController.json

  ```


  ![OpenAPI Documentation](openAPI.png)

ErikWittern/openapi-snippet: >
  # OpenAPI Snippet

  **Generates code snippets from Open API (previously Swagger) documents.**


  This package takes as input an OpenAPI v2.0 or v3.0.x document. It translates
  the document into an [HTTP Archive 1.2 request
  object](http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/har-12-spec/#request). It uses the
  [HTTP Snippet](https://github.com/Mashape/httpsnippet) library to generate
  code snippets for every API endpoint (URL path + HTTP method) defined in the
  specification in various languages & tools (`cURL`, `Node`, `Python`, `Ruby`,
  `Java`, `Go`, `C#`...), or for selected endpoints.


  ## Installation


  ```bash

  npm i openapi-snippet

  ```


  ## Build OpenAPI Snippet (for use in browser)

  Clone this repository. Install required dependencies:


  ```bash

  npm i

  ```


  Build a minified version of OpenAPI Snippet (`openapisnippet.min.js`):


  ```bash

  npm run build

  ```


  ## Usage


  ### As a module


  ```javascript

  const OpenAPISnippet = require('openapi-snippet')


  // define input:

  const openApi = ... // Open API document

  const targets = ['node_unirest', 'c'] // array of targets for code snippets.
  See list below...


  try {
    // either, get snippets for ALL endpoints:
    const results = OpenAPISnippet.getSnippets(openApi, targets) // results is now array of snippets, see "Output" below.

    // ...or, get snippets for a single endpoint:
    const results2 = OpenAPISnippet.getEndpointSnippets(openApi, '/users/{user-id}/relationship', 'get', targets)
  } catch (err) {
    // do something with potential errors...
  }

  ```


  ### Within the browser


  Include the `openapisnippet.min.js` file created after building the the
  library (see above) in your HTML page:


  ```html

  <script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/openapisnippet.min.js"></script>

  ```


  Use OpenAPI Snippet, which now defines the global variable `OpenAPISnippet`.



  ## Output

  The output for every endpoint is an object, containing the `method`, `url`, a
  human-readable `description`, and the corresponding `resource` - all of these
  values stem from the OpenAPI document. In addition, within the `snippets`
  list, an object containing a code snippet for every chosen target is provided.
  As of version `0.4.0`, the snippets include exemplary payload data.


  If `getSnippets` is used, an array of the above described objects is returned.


  For example:


  ```js

  [
    // ...
    {
      "method": "GET",
      "url": "https://api.instagram.com/v1/users/{user-id}/relationship",
      "description": "Get information about a relationship to another user.",
      "resource": "relationship",
      "snippets": [
        {
          "id": "node",
          "mimeType": "application/json",  // Only set for methods with a request body
          "title": "Node + Native",
          "content": "var http = require(\"https\");\n\nvar options = {..."
        }
      ]
    }
    // ...
  ]

  ```


  ## Targets

  Chai and Jest support for asserting that HTTP responses satisfy an OpenAPI
  spec.


  ## Problem


  If your server's behaviour doesn't match your API documentation, then you need
  to correct your server, your documentation, or both. The sooner you know the
  better.


  ## Solution


  These plugin let you automatically test whether your server's behaviour and
  documentation match. They extend Chai and Jest to support the [OpenAPI
  standard](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) for documenting REST
  APIs. In your JavaScript tests, you can simply assert
  `expect(responseObject).toSatisfyApiSpec()`

  Schemathesis

  ============


  |Build| |Coverage| |Version| |Python versions| |Docs| |Chat| |License|


  Schemathesis is a tool for testing your web applications built with Open API /
  Swagger or GraphQL specifications.


  It reads the application schema and generates test cases which will ensure
  that your application is compliant with its schema.


  The application under test could be written in any language, the only thing
  you need is a valid API schema in a supported format.


  **Supported specification versions**:


  - Swagger 2.0

  - Open API 3.0.x

  - GraphQL June 2018


  More API specifications will be added in the future.


  Built with:


  - `hypothesis`_


  - `hypothesis_jsonschema`_


  - `hypothesis_graphql`_


  - `pytest`_


  Inspired by wonderful `swagger-conformance
  <https://github.com/olipratt/swagger-conformance>`_ project.


  **Docs**: https://schemathesis.readthedocs.io/en/stable/


  **Gitter**: https://gitter.im/kiwicom/schemathesis


  If you are looking for more information:


  - `An article
  <https://code.kiwi.com/schemathesis-property-based-testing-for-api-schemas-52811fd2b0a4>`_
  about Schemathesis by **@Stranger6667**

  - `A video <https://youtu.be/1lo7idI7uq8>`_ from FlaskCon 2020 by **@hultner**


  Installation

  ------------


  To install Schemathesis via ``pip`` run the following command:


  .. code:: bash

      pip install schemathesis

  Usage

  -----


  There are two basic ways to use Schemathesis:


  - `Command Line Interface
  <https://github.com/kiwicom/schemathesis#command-line-interface>`_

  - `Writing tests in Python <https://github.com/kiwicom/schemathesis#in-code>`_


  CLI is pretty simple to use and requires no coding, in-code approach gives
  more flexibility.


  Command Line Interface

  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


  The ``schemathesis`` command can be used to perform Schemathesis test cases:


  .. code:: bash

      schemathesis run https://example.com/api/swagger.json

  .. image::
  https://github.com/kiwicom/schemathesis/blob/master/img/schemathesis.gif


  If your application requires authorization then you can use ``--auth`` option
  for Basic Auth and ``--header`` to specify

  custom headers to be sent with each request.


  To filter your tests by endpoint name, HTTP method, Open API tags or
  operationId you could use ``-E``, ``-M``, ``-T``, ``-O`` options respectively.


  CLI supports passing options to ``hypothesis.settings``. All of them are
  prefixed with ``--hypothesis-``:


  .. code:: bash

      schemathesis run --hypothesis-max-examples=1000 https://example.com/api/swagger.json

  To speed up the testing process Schemathesis provides ``-w/--workers`` option
  for concurrent test execution:


  .. code:: bash

      schemathesis run -w 8 https://example.com/api/swagger.json

  In the example above all tests will be distributed among 8 worker threads.


  If you'd like to test your web app (Flask or AioHTTP or FastAPI for example)
  then there is ``--app`` option for you:


  .. code:: bash

      schemathesis run --app=importable.path:app /swagger.json

  You need to specify an importable path to the module where your app instance
  resides and a variable name after ``:`` that points

  to your app. **Note**, app factories are not supported. The schema location
  could be:


  - A full URL;

  - An existing filesystem path;

  - In-app endpoint with schema.


  This method is significantly faster for WSGI apps, since it doesn't involve
  network.


  For the full list of options, run:


  .. code:: bash

      schemathesis --help
      # Or
      schemathesis run --help

  Docker

  ~~~~~~


  Schemathesis CLI also available as a docker image


  .. code:: bash

      docker run kiwicom/schemathesis:stable run http://example.com/schema.json

  To run it against localhost server add ``--network=host`` parameter:


  .. code:: bash

      docker run --network="host" kiwicom/schemathesis:stable run http://127.0.0.1/schema.json

  Pre-run CLI hook

  ################


  Sometimes you need to execute custom code before the CLI run, for example
  setup an environment,

  register custom string format strategies or modify Schemathesis behavior in
  runtime you can use ``--pre-run`` hook:


  .. code:: bash

      schemathesis --pre-run importable.path.to.module run https://example.com/api/swagger.json

  **NOTE**. This option should be passed before the ``run`` part.


  The passed value will be processed as an importable Python path, where you can
  execute your code.

  An example - https://github.com/kiwicom/schemathesis#custom-string-strategies


  Registering custom checks for CLI

  #################################


  To add a new check for the Schemathesis CLI there is a special function


  .. code:: python

      import schemathesis

      @schemathesis.register_check
      def new_check(response, case):
          # some awesome assertions!
          pass

  The registered check should accept a ``response`` with ``requests.Response`` /
  ``schemathesis.utils.WSGIResponse`` type and

  ``case`` with ``schemathesis.models.Case`` type.


  After registration, your checks will be available in Schemathesis CLI and you
  can use them via ``-c`` command line option.


  .. code:: bash

      schemathesis --pre-run module.with.checks run -c new_check https://example.com/api/swagger.json

  Additionally, checks may return ``True`` to skip the check under certain
  conditions. For example, you may only want to run checks when the

  response code is ``200``.


  .. code:: python

      import schemathesis

      @schemathesis.register_check
      def conditional_check(response, case):
          if response.status_code == 200:
              # some awesome assertions!
          else:
              # check not relevant to this response, skip test
              return True

  In-code

  ~~~~~~~


  To examine your application with Schemathesis you need to:


  - Setup & run your application, so it is accessible via the network;

  - Write a couple of tests in Python;

  - Run the tests via ``pytest``.


  Suppose you have your application running on ``http://0.0.0.0:8080`` and its

  schema is available at ``http://0.0.0.0:8080/swagger.json``.


  A basic test, that will verify that any data, that fit into the schema will
  not cause any internal server error could

  look like this:


  .. code:: python

      # test_api.py
      import requests
      import schemathesis

      schema = schemathesis.from_uri("http://0.0.0.0:8080/swagger.json")

      @schema.parametrize()
      def test_no_server_errors(case):
          # `requests` will make an appropriate call under the hood
          response = case.call()  # use `call_wsgi` if you used `schemathesis.from_wsgi`
          # You could use built-in checks
          case.validate_response(response)
          # Or assert the response manually
          assert response.status_code < 500


  It consists of four main parts:


  1. Schema preparation; ``schemathesis`` package provides multiple ways to
  initialize the schema - ``from_path``, ``from_dict``, ``from_uri``,
  ``from_file`` and ``from_wsgi``.


  2. Test parametrization; ``@schema.parametrize()`` generates separate tests
  for all endpoint/method combination available in the schema.


  3. A network call to the running application; ``case.call`` does it.


  4. Verifying a property you'd like to test; In the example, we verify that any
  app response will not indicate a server-side error (HTTP codes 5xx).


  **NOTE**. Look for ``from_wsgi`` usage `below
  <https://github.com/kiwicom/schemathesis#wsgi>`_


  Run the tests:


  .. code:: bash

      pytest test_api.py

  **Other properties that could be tested**:


  - Any call will be processed in <50 ms - you can verify the app performance;

  - Any unauthorized access will end with 401 HTTP response code;


  Each test function should have the ``case`` fixture, that represents a single
  test case.


  Important ``Case`` attributes:


  - ``method`` - HTTP method

  - ``formatted_path`` - full endpoint path

  - ``headers`` - HTTP headers

  - ``query`` - query parameters

  - ``body`` - request body


  You can use them manually in network calls or can convert to a dictionary
  acceptable by ``requests.request``:


  .. code:: python

      import requests

      schema = schemathesis.from_uri("http://0.0.0.0:8080/swagger.json")

      @schema.parametrize()
      def test_no_server_errors(case):
          kwargs = case.as_requests_kwargs()
          response = requests.request(**kwargs)


  For each test, Schemathesis will generate a bunch of random inputs acceptable
  by the schema.

  This data could be used to verify that your application works in the way as
  described in the schema or that schema describes expected behavior.


  By default, there will be 100 test cases per endpoint/method combination.

  To limit the number of examples you could use ``hypothesis.settings``
  decorator on your test functions:


  .. code:: python

      from hypothesis import settings

      @schema.parametrize()
      @settings(max_examples=5)
      def test_something(client, case):
          ...

  To narrow down the scope of the schemathesis tests it is possible to filter by
  method or endpoint:


  .. code:: python

      @schema.parametrize(method="GET", endpoint="/pet")
      def test_no_server_errors(case):
          ...

  The acceptable values are regexps or list of regexps (matched with
  ``re.search``).


  WSGI applications support

  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


  Schemathesis supports making calls to WSGI-compliant applications instead of
  real network calls, in this case

  the test execution will go much faster.


  .. code:: python

      app = Flask("test_app")

      @app.route("/schema.json")
      def schema():
          return {...}

      @app.route("/v1/users", methods=["GET"])
      def users():
          return jsonify([{"name": "Robin"}])

      schema = schemathesis.from_wsgi("/schema.json", app)

      @schema.parametrize()
      def test_no_server_errors(case):
          response = case.call_wsgi()
          assert response.status_code < 500

  Explicit examples

  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


  If the schema contains parameters examples, then they will be additionally
  included in the generated cases.

  Schemathesis supports the use of both OpenAPI ``example`` and ``examples``
  (more information available in the `OpenAPI documentation
  <https://swagger.io/docs/specification/adding-examples/>`_).

  Note that ``examples`` were added in OpenAPI 3, but Schemathesis supports this
  feature for OpenAPI 2 using ``x-examples``.


  .. code:: yaml

      paths:
        get:
          parameters:
          - in: body
            name: body
            required: true
            schema: '#/definitions/Pet'

      definitions:
        Pet:
          additionalProperties: false
          example:
            name: Doggo
          properties:
            name:
              type: string
          required:
          - name
          type: object


  With this Swagger schema example, there will be a case with body ``{"name":
  "Doggo"}``.  Examples handled with

  ``example`` decorator from Hypothesis, more info about its behavior is
  `here`_.


  If you'd like to test only examples provided in the schema, you could utilize
  ``--hypothesis-phases=explicit`` CLI option:


  .. code:: bash

      $ schemathesis run --hypothesis-phases=explicit https://example.com/api/swagger.json

  Or add this decorator to your test if you use Schemathesis in your Python
  tests:


  .. code:: python

      from hypothesis import settings, Phase

      ...
      @schema.parametrize()
      @settings(phases=[Phase.explicit])
      def test_api(case):
          ...

  **NOTE**. Schemathesis supports examples in individual properties.

  See below:


  .. code:: yaml

      ...
      paths:
        /users:
          parameters:
            - in: query
              name: foo
              schema:
                type: object
                properties:
                  prop1:
                    type: string
                    example: prop1 example    # SUPPORTED!
          post:
            requestBody:
              content:
                application/json:
                  schema:
                    type: object
                    properties:
                      foo:
                        type: string
                        example: bar          # SUPPORTED!

  Direct strategies access

  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


  For convenience you can explore the schemas and strategies manually:


  .. code:: python

      >>> import schemathesis
      >>> schema = schemathesis.from_uri("http://0.0.0.0:8080/petstore.json")
      >>> endpoint = schema["/pet"]["POST"]
      >>> strategy = endpoint.as_strategy()
      >>> strategy.example()
      Case(
          path='/pet',
          method='POST',
          path_parameters={},
          headers={},
          cookies={},
          query={},
          body={
              'name': '\x15.\x13\U0008f42a',
              'photoUrls': ['\x08\U0009f29a', '\U000abfd6\U000427c4', '']
          },
          form_data={}
      )

  Schema instances implement ``Mapping`` protocol.


  **NOTE**. Paths are relative to the schema's base path (``host`` +
  ``basePath`` in Open API 2.0 and ``server.url`` in Open API 3.0):


  .. code:: python

      # your ``basePath`` is ``/api/v1``
      >>> schema["/pet"]["POST"]  # VALID
      >>> schema["/api/v1/pet"]["POST"]  # INVALID

  Lazy loading

  ~~~~~~~~~~~~


  If you have a schema that is not available when the tests are collected, for
  example it is build with tools

  like ``apispec`` and requires an application instance available, then you can
  parametrize the tests from a pytest fixture.


  .. code:: python

      # test_api.py
      import schemathesis

      schema = schemathesis.from_pytest_fixture("fixture_name")

      @schema.parametrize()
      def test_api(case):
          ...

  In this case the test body will be used as a sub-test via ``pytest-subtests``
  library.


  **NOTE**: the used fixture should return a valid schema that could be created
  via ``schemathesis.from_dict`` or other

  ``schemathesis.from_`` variations.


  Extending schemathesis

  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


  If you're looking for a way to extend ``schemathesis`` or reuse it in your own
  application, then ``runner`` module might be helpful for you.

  It can run tests against the given schema URI and will do some simple checks
  for you.


  .. code:: python

      from schemathesis import runner

      events = runner.prepare("http://127.0.0.1:8080/swagger.json")
      for event in events:
          # do something with event

  ``runner.prepare`` creates a generator that yields events of different kinds -
  ``BeforeExecution``, ``AfterExecution``, etc.

  They provide a lot of useful information about what happens during tests, but
  handling of these events is your responsibility.

  You can take some inspiration from Schemathesis `CLI implementation
  <https://github.com/kiwicom/schemathesis/blob/master/src/schemathesis/cli/__init__.py#L230>`_.

  See full description of events in the `source code
  <https://github.com/kiwicom/schemathesis/blob/master/src/schemathesis/runner/events.py>`_.


  If you want to use Schemathesis CLI with your custom checks, look at `this
  section
  <https://github.com/kiwicom/schemathesis/tree/dd/deprecate-execute#registering-custom-checks-for-cli>`_


  The built-in checks list includes the following:


  - Not a server error. Asserts that response's status code is less than 500;

  - Status code conformance. Asserts that response's status code is listed in
  the schema;

  - Content type conformance. Asserts that response's content type is listed in
  the schema;

  - Response schema conformance. Asserts that response's content conforms to the
  declared schema;


  You can provide your custom checks to the execute function, the check is a
  callable that accepts one argument of ``requests.Response`` type.


  .. code:: python

      from datetime import timedelta
      from schemathesis import runner, models

      def not_too_long(response, case: models.Case):
          assert response.elapsed < timedelta(milliseconds=300)

      events = runner.prepare("http://127.0.0.1:8080/swagger.json", checks=[not_too_long])
      for event in events:
          # do something with event

  Custom string strategies

  ########################


  Some string fields could use custom format and validators,

  e.g. ``card_number`` and Luhn algorithm validator.


  For such cases it is possible to register custom strategies:


  1. Create ``hypothesis.strategies.SearchStrategy`` object

  2. Optionally provide predicate function to filter values

  3. Register it via ``schemathesis.register_string_format``


  .. code-block:: python

      strategy = strategies.from_regex(r"\A4[0-9]{15}\Z").filter(luhn_validator)
      schemathesis.register_string_format("visa_cards", strategy)

  Schemathesis supports Python's built-in ``unittest`` framework out of the box,

  you only need to specify strategies for ``hypothesis.given``:


  .. code-block:: python

      from unittest import TestCase
      from hypothesis import given
      import schemathesis

      schema = schemathesis.from_uri("http://0.0.0.0:8080/petstore.json")
      new_pet_strategy = schema["/v2/pet"]["POST"].as_strategy()

      class TestSchema(TestCase):

          @given(case=new_pet_strategy)
          def test_pets(self, case):
              response = case.call()
              assert response.status_code < 500

  Schema validation

  #################


  To avoid obscure and hard to debug errors during test runs Schemathesis
  validates input schemas for conformance with the relevant spec.

  If you'd like to disable this behavior use ``--validate-schema=false`` in CLI
  and ``validate_schema=False`` argument in loaders.


  Local development

  -----------------


  First, you need to prepare a virtual environment with `poetry`_.

  Install ``poetry`` (check out the `installation guide`_) and run this command
  inside the project root:


  .. code:: bash

      poetry install

  For simpler local development Schemathesis includes a ``aiohttp``-based server
  with the following endpoints in Swagger 2.0 schema:


  - ``/api/success`` - always returns ``{"success": true}``

  - ``/api/failure`` - always returns 500

  - ``/api/slow`` - always returns ``{"slow": true}`` after 250 ms delay

  - ``/api/unsatisfiable`` - parameters for this endpoint are impossible to
  generate

  - ``/api/invalid`` - invalid parameter definition. Uses ``int`` instead of
  ``integer``

  - ``/api/flaky`` - returns 1/1 ratio of 200/500 responses

  - ``/api/multipart`` - accepts multipart data

  - ``/api/teapot`` - returns 418 status code, that is not listed in the schema

  - ``/api/text`` - returns ``plain/text`` responses, which are not declared in
  the schema

  - ``/api/malformed_json`` - returns malformed JSON with ``application/json``
  content type header



  To start the server:


  .. code:: bash

      ./test_server.sh 8081

  It is possible to configure available endpoints via ``--endpoints`` option.

  The value is expected to be a comma separated string with endpoint names
  (``success``, ``failure``, ``slow``, etc):


  .. code:: bash

      ./test_server.sh 8081 --endpoints=success,slow

  Then you could use CLI against this server:


  .. code:: bash

      schemathesis run http://127.0.0.1:8081/schema.yaml
      ================================== Schemathesis test session starts =================================

  webhooks)

  * **Integration** with popular libraries (Requests, Werkzeug) and frameworks
  (Django, Falcon, Flask, Starlette)

  * Customization with media type **deserializers** and format **unmarshallers**

  * **Security** data providers (API keys, Cookie, Basic and Bearer HTTP
  authentications)



  Documentation

  #############


  Check documentation to see more details about the features. All documentation
  is in the "docs" directory and online at `openapi-core.readthedocs.io
  <https://openapi-core.readthedocs.io>`__



  Installation

  ############


  Recommended way (via pip):


  .. code-block:: console

     pip install openapi-core

  Alternatively you can download the code and install from the repository:


  .. code-block:: console

     pip install -e git+https://github.com/python-openapi/openapi-core.git#egg=openapi_core


  First steps

  ###########


  Firstly create your specification object.


  .. code-block:: python

     from openapi_core import Spec

     spec = Spec.from_file_path('openapi.json')

  Now you can use it to validate and unmarshal against requests and/or
  responses. 


  .. code-block:: python

     from openapi_core import unmarshal_request

     # raises error if request is invalid
     result = unmarshal_request(request, spec=spec)

  Retrieve validated and unmarshalled request data


  .. code-block:: python

     # get parameters
     path_params = result.parameters.path
     query_params = result.parameters.query
     cookies_params = result.parameters.cookies
     headers_params = result.parameters.headers
     # get body
     body = result.body
     # get security data
     security = result.security

  Request object should implement OpenAPI Request protocol. Check `Integrations
  <https://openapi-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/integrations.html>`__ to find
  oficially supported implementations.


  For more details read about `Unmarshalling
  <https://openapi-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/unmarshalling.html>`__ process.


  If you just want to validate your request/response data without unmarshalling,
  read about `Validation
  <https://openapi-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/validation.html>`__ instead.

  The HTTP Mocking Toolkit (HMT) is a tool that mocks HTTP APIs for use in
  sandboxes as well as for automated and exploratory testing. It uses a
  combination of API definitions, recorded traffic and code in order to make
  crafting mocks as enjoyable as possible.

  ## Installation

  Install via [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) (requires
  **Python 3.6+**):


  ```bash

  pip install hmt

  ```


  macOS users can install HMT with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):


  ```sh

  brew tap meeshkan/tap

  brew install hmt

  ```


  Debian and Ubuntu users can install HMT with `apt`:


  ```sh

  echo "deb [trusted=yes] https://dl.bintray.com/meeshkan/apt all main" | tee -a
  /etc/apt/sources.list

  apt-get -qq update && apt-get install hmt

  ```



  ## Getting started with HMT


  The basic HMT flow is **collect, build and mock.**

  1. First, **collect** data from recorded server traffic and/or OpenAPI specs.

  1. Then, **build** a schema that unifies these various data sources.

  1. Finally, use this schema to create a **mock** server of an API.


  ### Tutorial


  The quickest way to get an overview of HMT is to complete our interactive
  tutorial. It walks you through the collect, build, and mock flow - while also
  covering the concepts necessary for development.


  _Note: This tutorial has been tested on Python 3.6, 3.7, and 3.8._


  After installing HMT, you can begin the tutorial by invoking from the command
  line:


  ```bash

  $ hmt tutorial

  ```


  Once you've run this, you should see:


  ```bash
      __              __ 
     / /_  ____ ___  / /_
    / __ \/ __ `__ \/ __/

  this repo](https://github.com/meeshkan/hmt/issues).


  ## Collect recordings of API traffic


  Let's look at how to build a HMT spec. First, you have to **collect**
  recordings of server traffic and/or OpenAPI server specs.


  To record API traffic, the HMT CLI provides a `record` mode that captures API
  traffic using a proxy.


  ```bash

  $ hmt record

  ```


  This command starts HMT as a reverse proxy on the default port of `8000` and
  creates two directories: `logs` and `specs`. 


  With [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/), for example, you can use HMT as a proxy
  like so:


  ```bash

  $ curl http://localhost:8000/http://api.example.com

  ```


  By default, the recording proxy treats the path as the target URL. It then
  writes a [`.jsonl`](https://jsonlines.org) file containing logs of all server
  traffic to the `logs` directory.  All logs are created in the
  [`http-types`](https://github.com/meeshkan/http-types) format. This is because
  HMT's `build` tool expects all recordings to be represented in a `.jsonl` file
  containing recordings represented in the `http-types` format.


  For more information about recording, including direct file writing and kafka
  streaming, see the [recording documentation](./docs/RECORD.md).


  ## Build a HMT spec from recordings


  Using the HMT CLI, you can **build** an OpenAPI schema from a single `.jsonl`
  file, in addition to any existing OpenAPI specs that describe how your service
  works.


  ```bash

  $ hmt build --input-file path/to/recordings.jsonl 

  ```


  _Note: The input file should be in [JSON Lines](http://jsonlines.org/) format
  and every line should be in [http-types](https://hmt.github.io/http-types/)
  JSON format. For an example input file, see
  [recordings.jsonl](./resources/recordings.jsonl)._


  Optionally, you can also specify an output directory using the `--out` flag
  followed by the path to this directory. By default, HMT will build the new
  OpenAPI specifications in the `specs` directory. 


  Use dash (`--input-file -`) to read from standard input:


  ```bash

  $ hmt build --input-file - < recordings.jsonl

  ```

  ### Building modes

  You can use a mode flag to indicate how the OpenAPI spec should be built, for
  example:


  ```bash

  hmt build --input-file path/to/recordings.jsonl --mode gen

  ```


  Supported modes are:

  * gen [default] - infer a schema from the recorded data

  * replay - replay the recorded data based on exact matching


  For more information about building, including mixing together the two modes
  and editing the created OpenAPI schema, see the [building
  documentation](./docs/BUILD.md).


  ## Mock server traffic using a HMT spec


  You can use an OpenAPI spec, such as the one created with `hmt build`, to
  create a **mock** server using HMT.


  ```bash

  $ hmt mock path/to/dir/

  ```


  _Note: You can specify a path to the directory your OpenAPI spec is in or a
  path to one specific file._


  For more information about mocking, including adding custom middleware and
  modifying the mocking schema JIT via an admin API, see the [mocking
  documentation](./docs/MOCK.md).


  ## Development


  Here are some useful tips for building and running HMT from source. 


  If you run into any issues, please [reach out to our team on
  Gitter](https://gitter.im/HMT/community).


  ### Getting started


  1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/meeshkan/hmt`

  1. Create a virtual environment: `python3 -m venv .venv && source
  .venv/bin/activate`

  1. Install dependencies: `pip install --upgrade -e '.[dev]'`

  1. Install [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks to automatically
  format code as a git hook: `pre-commit install`


  ### Tests


  Run all checks:


  ```bash

  $ python setup.py test

  ```


  #### `pytest`


  Run [tests/](https://github.com/meeshkan/hmt/tree/master/tests/) with
  `pytest`:


  ```bash

  pytest

  # or

  python setup.py test

  ```


  Configuration for `pytest` is found in
  [pytest.ini](https://github.com/meeshkan/hmt/tree/master/pytest.ini).


  #### Formatting


  Formatting is checked by the above mentioned `python setup.py test` command.


  To fix formatting:


  ```sh

  $ python setup.py format

  ```


  #### `flake8`


  Run style checks:


  ```bash

  $ flake8 .

  ```


  #### `pyright`


  You can run type-checking by installing
  [pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright) globally:


  ```bash

  $ npm -i -g pyright

  ```


  And then running:


  ```bash

  $ pyright --lib

  $ # or

  $ python setup.py typecheck

  ```


  Using the [Pyright
  extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-pyright.pyright)
  is recommended for development in VS Code.


  ### Automated builds


  Configuration for CircleCI [build
  pipeline](https://app.circleci.com/github/HMT/hmt/pipelines) can be found in
  [.circleci/config.yml](https://github.com/meeshkan/hmt/tree/master/.circleci/config.yml).


  ### Publishing HMT as a PyPi package


  To publish HMT as a PyPi package, complete the following steps:


  1. Bump the version in
  [setup.py](https://github.com/meeshkan/hmt/tree/master/setup.py) if the
  version is the same as in the published
  [package](https://pypi.org/project/hmt/). Commit and push.

  1. Run `python setup.py test` to check that everything works

  1. To build and upload the package, run `python setup.py upload`. Insert PyPI
  credentials to upload the package to `PyPI`. The command will also run `git
  tag` to tag the commit as a release and push the tags to remote.


  > To see what the different commands do, see `Command` classes in
  [setup.py](https://github.com/meeshkan/hmt/tree/master/setup.py).

      validate                Validates an API definition in Swagger 2.0 or OpenAPI 3.0 format

      bundle                  Bundles a multi-file API definition into a single file

  Options:
      -h, --help              Show help for any command
      -v, --version           Output the CLI version number
      -d, --debug [filter]    Show debug output, optionally filtered (e.g. "*", "swagger:*", etc.)
  ```



  ### Validate an API


  The `swagger-cli validate` command will validate your Swagger/OpenAPI
  definition against the [Swagger 2.0
  schema](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/schemas/v2.0/schema.json)
  or [OpenAPI 3.0
  Schema](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/schemas/v3.0/schema.json). 
  It also performs additional validations against the
  [specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md),
  which will catch some things that aren't covered by the schema, such as
  duplicate parameters, invalid MIME types, etc.


  The command will exit with a non-zero code if the API is invalid.


  ```

  swagger-cli validate [options] <file>


  Options:
      --no-schema             Do NOT validate against the Swagger/OpenAPI JSON schema

      --no-spec               Do NOT validate against the Swagger/OpenAPI specification
  ```


  #### Git pre-commit hook


  There is a useful Python tool called [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)
  that can be used to execute a wide suite of pre-commit checks. The
  `swagger-cli validate` command can be integrated as part of a git pre-commit
  hook by adding the following configuration to the `repos` entry of an existing
  `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file.


  ```

  -   repo: https://github.com/APIDevTools/swagger-cli
      rev: v2.2.1
      hooks:
      - id: swagger-validation
        args: ["validate", "<path to root swagger>"]
  ```


  The intention is to point to single root swagger that references multiple
  swagger definitions. The above hook will execute the `swagger-cli validation`
  against the root swagger anytime that a file matching the pattern
  `.*swagger.*\.(json|yaml|yml)` is modified. Any failures in this validation
  will prevent the git commit from being processed.


  ### Combine Multiple Files


  The Swagger and OpenAPI specs allows you to split your API definition across
  multiple files using [`$ref`
  pointers](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#reference-object)
  to reference each file. You can use the `swagger-cli bundle` command to
  combine all of those referenced files into a single file, which is useful for
  distribution or interoperation with other tools.


  By default, the `swagger-cli bundle` command tries to keep the output file
  size as small as possible, by only embedding each referenced file _once_.  If
  the same file is referenced multiple times, then any subsequent references are
  simply modified to point to the _single_ inlined copy of the file.  If you
  want to produce a bundled file without _any_ `$ref` pointers, then add the
  `--dereference` option.  This will result in a larger file size, since
  multiple references to the same file will result in that file being embedded
  multiple times.


  If you don't specify the `--outfile` option, then the bundled API will be
  written to stdout, which means you can pipe it to other commands.


  The result of this method by default is written as JSON. It can be changed to
  YAML with the `--type` option, by passing the `yaml` value.


  ```

  swagger-cli bundle [options] <file>


  Options:
      -o, --outfile <file>        The output file

      -r, --dereference           Fully dereference all $ref pointers

      -f, --format <spaces>       Formats the output using the given number of spaces
                                  (the default is 2 spaces)

      -t, --type <filetype>       Defines the output file type. The valid values are: json, yaml
                                  (the default is JSON)

      -w, --wrap <column>         Set the line length for YAML strings
                                  (the default is no wrapping)
  ```

  Features

  --------------------------

  - **Supports Swagger 2.0 specs in JSON or YAML** <br>

  Swagger Express Middleware uses
  [Swagger-Parser](https://github.com/APIDevTools/swagger-parser) to parse,
  validate, and dereference Swagger files.  You can even split your spec into
  multiple different files using `$ref` pointers.


  - **Thoroughly tested**<br>

  Over 1,000 unit tests and integration tests with 100% code coverage.  Tested
  on [**over 1,500 real-world APIs**](https://apis.guru/browse-apis/) from
  Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Spotify, etc.  All tests are run on Mac, Linux,
  and Windows using all LTS versions of Node.


  - [**Mock
  middleware**](https://apitools.dev/swagger-express-middleware/docs/middleware/mock.html)<br>

  **Fully-functional mock** implementations for every operation in your API,
  including data persistence, all with **zero code!**  This is a great way to
  test-drive your API as you write it, or for quick demos and POCs.  You can
  even extend the mock middleware with your own logic and data to fill in any
  gaps.


  - [**Metadata
  middleware**](https://apitools.dev/swagger-express-middleware/docs/middleware/metadata.html)<br>

  Annotates each request with all the relevant information from the Swagger
  definition.  The path, the operation, the parameters, the security
  requirements - they're all easily accessible at `req.swagger`.


  - [**Parse Request
  middleware**](https://apitools.dev/swagger-express-middleware/docs/middleware/parseRequest.html)<br>

  Parses incoming requests and converts everything into the correct data types,
  according to your Swagger API definition.


  - [**Validate Request
  middleware**](https://apitools.dev/swagger-express-middleware/docs/middleware/validateRequest.html)<br>

  Ensures that every request complies with your Swagger API definition, or
  returns the appropriate HTTP error codes if needed.  Of course, you can catch
  any validation errors and handle them however you want.


  - [**CORS
  middleware**](https://apitools.dev/swagger-express-middleware/docs/middleware/CORS.html)<br>

  Adds the appropriate CORS headers to each request and automatically responds
  to CORS preflight requests, all in compliance with your Swagger API
  definition.


  - [**Files
  middleware**](https://apitools.dev/swagger-express-middleware/docs/middleware/files.html)<br>

  Serves the Swagger API file(s) in JSON or YAML format so they can be used with
  front-end tools like [Swagger UI](http://www.swagger.io), [Swagger
  Editor](http://editor.swagger.io), and [Postman](http://getpostman.com).




  Installation and Use

  --------------------------

  Install using [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm/).


  ```bash

  npm install @apidevtools/swagger-express-middleware

  ```

  Then use it in your [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) script like this:


  ```javascript

  const express = require('express');

  const createMiddleware = require('@apidevtools/swagger-express-middleware');


  let app = express();


  createMiddleware('PetStore.yaml', app, function(err, middleware) {
      // Add all the Swagger Express Middleware, or just the ones you need.
      // NOTE: Some of these accept optional options (omitted here for brevity)
      app.use(
          middleware.metadata(),
          middleware.CORS(),
          middleware.files(),
          middleware.parseRequest(),
          middleware.validateRequest(),
          middleware.mock()
      );

      app.listen(8000, function() {
          console.log('The PetStore sample is now running at http://localhost:8000');
      });
  });

  ```




  Samples & Walkthroughs

  --------------------------

  Swagger Express Middleware comes two samples that use the [Swagger Pet Store
  API](https://github.com/APIDevTools/swagger-express-middleware/blob/master/samples/PetStore.yaml).


  #### Sample 1

  This sample demonstrates the most simplistic usage of Swagger Express
  Middleware. It simply creates a new Express Application and adds all of the
  Swagger middleware without changing any options, and without adding any custom
  middleware.

  *
  [Walkthrough](https://apitools.dev/swagger-express-middleware/docs/walkthroughs/running.html)



  #### Sample 2

  This sample demonstrates a few more advanced features of Swagger Express
  Middleware, such as setting a few options, initializing the mock data store,
  and adding custom middleware logic.

  Example

  --------------------------


  ```javascript

  SwaggerParser.validate(myAPI, (err, api) => {
    if (err) {
      console.error(err);
    }
    else {
      console.log("API name: %s, Version: %s", api.info.title, api.info.version);
    }
  });

  ```


  Or use `async`/`await` or
  [Promise](http://javascriptplayground.com/blog/2015/02/promises/) syntax
  instead. The following example is the same as above:


  ```javascript

  try {
    let api = await SwaggerParser.validate(myAPI);
    console.log("API name: %s, Version: %s", api.info.title, api.info.version);
  }

  catch(err) {
    console.error(err);
  }

  ```


  For more detailed examples, please see the [API
  Documentation](https://apitools.dev/swagger-parser/docs/)




  Installation

  --------------------------

  Install using [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm/):


  ```bash

  npm install @apidevtools/swagger-parser

  ```




  Usage

  --------------------------

  When using Swagger Parser in Node.js apps, you'll probably want to use
  **CommonJS** syntax:


  ```javascript

  const SwaggerParser = require("@apidevtools/swagger-parser");

  ```


  When using a transpiler such as [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) or
  [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), or a bundler such as
  [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) or [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/), you can
  use **ECMAScript modules** syntax instead:


  ```javascript

  import * as SwaggerParser from '@apidevtools/swagger-parser';

  ```




  Browser support

  --------------------------

  Swagger Parser supports recent versions of every major web browser.  Older
  browsers may require [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) and/or
  [polyfills](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/next/babel-polyfill).


  To use Swagger Parser in a browser, you'll need to use a bundling tool such as
  [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/),
  [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/), or [Browserify](http://browserify.org/). Some
  bundlers may require a bit of configuration, such as setting `browser: true`
  in
  [rollup-plugin-resolve](https://github.com/rollup/rollup-plugin-node-resolve).

  # The apicurio-studio project (Open Source API Design Studio)


  ## Summary


  This is the official Git repository for the apicurio studio project: 
  http://www.apicur.io/


  The apicurio studio project is a standalone API design studio that can be used
  to create

  new or edit existing API designs (using the OpenAPI specification).


  ## Get the code


  The easiest way to get started with the code is to [create your own
  fork](http://help.github.com/forking/)

  of this repository, and then clone your fork:

  ```bash
    $ git clone git@github.com:<you>/apicurio-studio.git
    $ cd apicurio-studio
    $ git remote add upstream git://github.com/apicurio/apicurio-studio.git
  ```

  At any time, you can pull changes from the upstream and merge them onto your
  master:

  ```bash
    $ git checkout master               # switches to the 'master' branch
    $ git pull upstream master          # fetches all 'upstream' changes and merges 'upstream/master' onto your 'master' branch
    $ git push origin                   # pushes all the updates to your fork, which should be in-sync with 'upstream'
  ```

  The general idea is to keep your 'master' branch in-sync with the
  'upstream/master'.


  ## Building apicurio-studio


  ### Requirements

  - Maven 3.x

  - Java 8 or 11 (recommended)


  The following command compiles all the code, installs the JARs into your local
  Maven repository, and runs all of the unit tests:

  ```bash
    $ mvn clean install
  ```

  ## Quickstart (i.e. How To Run It)


  The fastest way to get started using Apicurio Studio is to use the Quickstart.
  The Apicurio Studio bits required for this mode are produced as part 

  of the full maven build - you can find it in.  To start up the Dev Mode, once
  the project has been built, follow the instructions under the
  [quickstart](./distro/quickstart/QUICKSTART.md) directory.


  This will start the required Quarkus components on your local machine and you
  can access the UI at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).


  ## Contribute fixes and features


  Apicurio Studio is open source, and we welcome anybody who wants to
  participate and contribute!


  Please follow [Setting your development
  environment](https://apicurio-studio.readme.io/docs/setting-up-a-development-environment)
  guide to setup your local machine for development.  The guide assumes the use
  of the Eclipse IDE for Java

  development (backend) but is not required - developers should be able to adapt
  the instructions to their particular

  environment.


  An additional way that is less dependent on Eclipse is described in [this
  manual](DEV_MODE.md).


  If you want to fix a bug or make any changes, please [log an issue in
  GitHub](https://github.com/apicurio/apicurio-studio/issues) describing the bug

  or new feature. Then we highly recommend making the changes on a topic branch
  named with the JIRA issue number. For example, this command creates

  a branch for the APISTUDIO-1234 issue:

  ```bash
    $ git checkout -b apicurio-studio-1234
  ```

  After you're happy with your changes and a full build (with unit tests) runs
  successfully, commit your

  changes on your topic branch. Then it's time to check for and pull any recent
  changes that were made in

  the official repository:

  ```bash
    $ git checkout master               # switches to the 'master' branch
    $ git pull upstream master          # fetches all 'upstream' changes and merges 'upstream/master' onto your 'master' branch
    $ git checkout apicurio-studio-1234   # switches to your topic branch
    $ git rebase master                 # reapplies your changes on top of the latest in master
                                        # (i.e., the latest from master will be the new base for your changes)
  ```

  If the pull grabbed a lot of changes, you should rerun your build to make sure
  your changes are still good.

  You can then either [create patches](http://progit.org/book/ch5-2.html) (one
  file per commit, saved in `~/apicurio-studio-1234`) with

  ```bash
    $ git format-patch -M -o ~/apicurio-studio-1234 orgin/master
  ```

  and upload them to the JIRA issue, or you can push your topic branch and its
  changes into your public fork repository

  ```bash
    $ git push origin apicurio-studio-1234         # pushes your topic branch into your public fork of apicurio-studio
  ```

  and [generate a pull-request](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/) for your
  changes.


  We prefer pull-requests, because we can review the proposed changes, comment
  on them,

  discuss them with you, and likely merge the changes right into the official
  repository.


  Please try to create one commit per feature or fix, generally the easiest way
  to do this is via [git
  squash](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Squashing-Commits).

  This makes reverting changes easier, and avoids needlessly polluting the
  repository history with checkpoint commits.


  ## Code Formatting


  When you are hacking on some apicurio-studio code, we'd really appreciate it
  if you followed the

  apicurio-studio coding standards.  If you're using Eclipse, you can find a
  code formatter config

  file here:

  ```

  tools/src/eclipse/apicurio-eclipse-formatter.xml

  _"The confident hippie"_


  [![js-standard-style](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](http://standardjs.com/)

  [![Build
  Status](https://github.com/cachecontrol/hippie-swagger/workflows/Node.js%20CI/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/cachecontrol/hippie-swagger/workflows/Node.js%20CI/badge.svg?branch=master)

  [![npm
  version](https://badge.fury.io/js/hippie-swagger.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/hippie-swagger)


  ## Synopsis


  ```hippie-swagger``` is a tool for testing RESTful APIs.  In addition to
  validating api behavior, it will fail tests when swagger documentation is
  missing or inaccurate.


  As the test suite runs, any request or response details *not* matching the
  swagger file will throw an appropriate exception, failing the spec.  This
  ensures the swagger definition accurately describes application behavior,
  keeping documentation in sync with reality.


  ```hippie-swagger``` uses [hippie](https://github.com/vesln/hippie) under the
  hood, an excellent API testing tool.


  ## Features


  * All [hippie](https://github.com/vesln/hippie) features included

  * All aspects of swagger file validated; parameters, request/response body,
  paths, etc.

  * Checks for extra parameters, paths, headers, etc not mentioned in the
  swagger file

  * Ensures swagger file accurately describes API behavior

  * Accurate, human readable assertion messages


  ## Installation


  ```

  npm install hippie-swagger --save-dev

  ```


  ## Basic Usage


  ```js

  var hippie = require('hippie-swagger'),
      swagger = require('./my-dereferenced-swagger-file'); // see example for how to dereference swagger

  hippie(app, swagger)

  .get('/users/{username}')

  .pathParams({
    username: 'cachecontrol'
  })

  .expectStatus(200)

  .expectValue('user.first', 'John')

  .expectHeader('cache-control', 'no-cache')

  .end(function(err, res, body) {
    if (err) throw err;
  });

  ```


  ## Usage

  * See [hippie](https://github.com/vesln/hippie) documentation for a
  description of the base api

  * When specifying a url(.get, .post, .patch, .url, etc), use the [swagger
  path](http://swagger.io/specification/#pathsObject)

  * Provide any path variables using [pathParams](#pathparams)


  These aside, use hippie as you normally would; see the
  [example](example/index.js).


  ## Methods


  ### #constructor (Object app, Object swagger, Object [options])


  Test an HTTP app (like express) directly


  ```js

  hippie(app, swagger, options)

  .get('/projects')

  .end(fn);

  ```


  ### #constructor (Object swagger, Object [options])


  Test a remote HTTP app using a fully qualified url


  ```js

  hippie(swagger, options)

  .get('http://localhost:3000/projects')

  .end(fn);

  ```


  ### #pathParams(Object hash)


  Replaces variables contained in the swagger path.


  ```js

  hippie(app, swagger)

  .get('/projects/{projectId}/tasks/{taskId}')

  .pathParams({
    projectId: 123,
    taskId: 99
  })

  .end(fn);

  ```


  ## Options


  To customize behavior, an ```options``` hash may be passed to the
  constructor.  Typically, ```options``` only need to be specified in situations
  where the test covers responses to improper requests (e.g. validating the
  application returns a 422 when a required parameter is not provided).


  ```js

  var options = {
    validateResponseSchema: true,
    validateParameterSchema: true,
    errorOnExtraParameters: true,
    errorOnExtraHeaderParameters: false
  };

  hippie(app, swagger, options)

  ```


  ```validateResponseSchema``` - Validate the server's response against the
  swagger json-schema definition (default: ```true```)


  ```validateParameterSchema``` - Validate the request parameters against the
  swagger json-schema definition (default: ```true```)


  ```validateRequiredParameters``` - Validate that required parameters were
  provided  (default: ```true```)


  ```errorOnExtraParameters``` - Throw an error if a parameter is missing from
  the swagger file  (default: ```true```)


  ```errorOnExtraHeaderParameters``` - Throw an error if a request header is
  missing from the swagger file.  By default this is turned off, because it
  results in every request needing to specify the "Content-Type" and "Accept"
  headers, which quickly becomes verbose. (default: ```false```)



  ## Example

  See the [example](example/index.js) folder


  ## Validations


  When hippie-swagger detects it is interacting with the app in ways not
  specified in the swagger file, it will throw an error and fail the test.  The
  idea is to use hippie's core features to write API tests as per usual, and
  hippie-swagger will only interject if the swagger contract is violated.


  Below are list of some of the validations that hippie-swagger checks for:


  ### Paths

  ```js

  hippie(app, swagger)

  .get('/pathNotMentionedInSwagger')

  .end(fn);

  // path does not exist in swagger file; throws:

  //    Swagger spec does not define path: pathNotMentionedInSwagger

  ```


  ### Parameter format

  ```js

  hippie(app, swagger)

  .get('/users/{userId}')

  .pathParams({
    userId: 'string-value',
  })

  .end(fn);

  // userId provided as a string, but swagger specifies it as an integer;
  throws:

  //    Invalid format for parameter {userId}

  ```


  ### Required Parameters

  ```js

  hippie(app, swagger)

  .get('/users/{username}')

  .end(fn);

  // "username" is marked 'required' in swagger file; throws:

  //    Missing required parameter in path: username

  ```


  ### Extraneous Parameters

  ```js

  hippie(app, swagger)

  .get('/users')

  .qs({ page: 2, limit: 30 })

  .end(fn);

  // "page" missing from swagger file; throws:

  //    Error: query parameter not mentioned in swagger spec: "page", available
  params: limit

  ```


  ### Response format

  ```js

  hippie(app, swagger)

  .get('/users')

  .end(fn);

  // body failed to validate against swagger file's "response" schema; throws:

  //    Response from /users failed validation: [failure description]

  ```


  ### Method validation

  ```js

  hippie(app, swagger)

  .post('/users')

  .end(fn);

  // "post" method not mentioned in swagger file; throws:

  //    Swagger spec does not define method: "post" in path /users

  ```


  ### Post body format

  ```js

  hippie(app, swagger)

  .post('/users')

  .send({"bogus":"post-body"})

  .end(fn);


  // post body fails to validate against swagger file's "body" parameter;
  throws:

  //    Invalid format for parameter {body}, received: {"bogus":"post-body"}

  ```


  ### Form Url-Encoded Parameters

  ```js

  hippie(app, swagger)

  .form()

  .post('/users')

  .send({})

  .end(fn);


  // "username" is {required: true, in: formData} in swagger; throws:

  //    Missing required parameter in formData: username

  ```


  ### Multipart Forms

  ```js

  hippie(app, swagger)

  .header('Content-Type','multipart/form-data')

  .send()

  .post('/users/upload')

  .end(fn);


  // "fileUpload" is {required: true, in: formData, type: file} in swagger;
  throws:

  //    Missing required parameter in formData: fileUpload

  ```


  ## Troubleshooting


  The most common mistake is forgetting to dereference the swagger file:


  ```js

  "'Error: cant resolve reference ...'

  ```


  Dereferencing can be accomplished using
  [swagger-parser](https://github.com/BigstickCarpet/swagger-parser/blob/master/docs/swagger-parser.md#dereferenceapi-options-callback). 
  The [example](example/index.js) gives a demonstration.

If you use git run `git init` or `git clone ${repository path}`.\n- init go project by `git init` and `go mod init`\n- add `libgo` to your project dependency\n- install `libgo` with `lang_eng` or your desire language\n- initialize the project with desire domain e.g. `google.com`\n- build your organization app by `libgo build` or by `go build` with desire tags and target OS and hardwares.\n- run your desire version from /bin/ directory. Strongly suggest run app by systemd on linux or other app manager on other OS.\n\nor easily run the following command under your project, just replace your domain name.\n```\nmkdir {domain}\ngit init\ngo mod init\ngo get -u github.com/GeniusesGroup/libgo\ngo install github.com/GeniusesGroup/libgo -tags \"lang_eng\"\nlibgo app init -d={domain}\nlibgo build\n```\n\n## Commands (CLA)\nlibgo has a the command-line client for the some generator APIs implement in [modules](./modules/). It provides simple access to all APIs functions to make an application, a GUI app, ....\n\nYou can get list of all commands and their helps with `libgo help`. We just list some of important commands here that you can run them from within a Go module or any where in your project directory:\n- **Initialize a project:** `libgo app init -d=[internet-domain]`\n- **Add new domain module:** `libgo domain new -n=[domain-name]`\n\n## Build tags\n- **dev_mode**: first check and change `AppMode_Dev` const in protocol package to desire behavior\n- **tcp_listener**:\n\n### Developing hints\n- Complete manifest in main package of service.\n- Add other data to main package if needed.\n- Implement protocols logic by autogenerate some codes not write them manually.\n- Don't think about network when you develope a business service logic. Use `st protocol.Stream` as stream data not network stream and don't remove it even don't need it from `Process` method arguments.\n\n## Protocols\nYou can find protocol descriptions in its directory as now [protocol](./protocol/), [society](./society/), [ISO](./iso/)    \nRead more about each protocol or library in its [RFC](https://github.com/GeniusesGroup/RFCs)\nAs [suggest here](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/48087) to comply with the standards we add [protocol](./protocol) package and all other libgo packages implement this package. You can implement these protocols in your own way if our packages can't satisfied you or your requirements.   \nA standard is a formalized protocol accepted by most of the parties that implement it. A protocol is not a set of rules. A protocol is the thing those rules describe the rules of.

The extension has undergone a complete overhaul to improve both its `UI`/`UX` and performance. These changes ensure that the extension is modern and optimised for use.\n\n## Swurg is a `Burp Suite` extension designed for `OpenAPI`-based `API` testing\n\n> The `OpenAPI` Specification (`OAS`) defines a standard, programming language-agnostic interface description for `REST` `APIs`, which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of a service without requiring access to source code, additional documentation, or inspection of network traffic. When properly defined via `OpenAPI`, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic. Similar to what interface descriptions have done for lower-level programming, the `OpenAPI` Specification removes guesswork in calling a service.\n>\n> Use cases for machine-readable `API` definition documents include, but are not limited to: interactive documentation; code generation for documentation, clients, and servers; and automation of test cases. `OpenAPI` documents describe an `API`'s services and are represented in either `YAML` or `JSON` formats. These documents may either be produced and served statically or be generated dynamically from an application.\n>\n> \\- [`OpenAPI` Initiative](https://github.com/OAI/`OpenAPI`-Specification)\n\nPerforming security assessment of `OpenAPI`-based `APIs` can be a tedious task due to `Burp Suite` (industry standard) lacking native `OpenAPI` parsing capabilities. A solution to this situation, is to use third-party tools (e.g. `SOAP-UI`) or to implement custom scripts (often on a per engagement basis) to handle the parsing of `OpenAPI` documents and integrate/chain the results to `Burp Suite` to use its first class scanning capabilities.\n\nSwurg is an `OpenAPI` parser that aims to streamline this entire process by allowing security professionals to use `Burp Suite` as a standalone tool for security assessment of `OpenAPI`-based `APIs`.\n\n## Features\n\n- `OpenAPI` documents can be parsed either from a supplied file or URL. The extension can fetch `OpenAPI` documents directly from a URL using the `Send to Swagger Parser` feature under the `Target -> Site map` context menu.\n- Parse `OpenAPI` documents, formerly known as the `Swagger specification`, fully compliant with `OpenAPI` 2.0/3.0 Specifications (`OAS`).\n- Requests can be directly viewed/edited within the extension prior to sending them to other Burp tools.\n- Requests can be sent to the `Comparer, Intruder, Repeater, Scanner, Site map and Scope` Burp tools.\n- Requests matching specific criterias (detailed in the 'Parameters' tab) can be intercepted to automatically match and replace the parsed parameters default values defined in the 'Parameters' tab. This feature allows for fine-tuning of the requests prior to sending them to other Burp tools (e.g., scanner). Edited requests can be viewed within the 'Modified Request (`OpenAPI` Parser)' tab of Burp's message editor.\n- Row highlighting allowing pentesters to highlight \"interesting\" `API` calls and/or colour code them for reporting purposes.\n- Includes an export to `CSV` feature, allowing users to easily export selected `API` requests in `CSV` format for further analysis or reporting.\n- Supports both `JSON` and `YAML` formats.\n\n## Requirements\n\n### 1. System requirements\n\n- Operating System: Compatible with `Linux`, `macOS`, and `Windows` operating systems.\n- Java Development Kit (JDK): `Version 11` or later.\n- Burp Suite Professional or Community Edition: `Version 2023.3.2` or later.\n\n  > [!IMPORTANT]\n  > Please note that using any version lower than `2023.3.2` may result in a [java.lang.NoSuchMethodError](https://forum.portswigger.net/thread/montoya-api-nosuchmethoderror-275048be). It is crucial to use the specified version or a more recent one to avoid this issue.\n\n### 2. Build tool\n\n- Gradle: `Version 6.9` or later (recommended). The [build.gradle](https://github.com/aress31/swurg/blob/main/lib/build.gradle) file is provided in the project repository.\n\n### 3. Environment variables\n\n- Set up the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to point to the JDK installation directory.\n\nPlease ensure that all system requirements, including a compatible version of `Burp Suite`, are met before building and running the project. Note that the project's external dependencies will be automatically managed and installed by `Gradle` during the build process. Adhering to the requirements will help avoid potential issues and reduce the need for opening new issues in the project repository.\n\n## Installation\n\n### 1. Compilation\n\n1. Ensure you have [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) installed and configured.\n\n2. Download the `swurg` repository:\n\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/aress31/swurg\n   cd .\\swurg\\\n   ```\n\n3. Build the standalone `jar`:\n\n   ```bash\n   ./gradlew fatJar\n   ```\n\n### 2. Loading the Extension Into `Burp Suite`\n\nTo install `swurg` in `Burp Suite`, first go to the `Extensions` tab and click on the `Add` button. Then, select the `swurg-all` jar file located in the `.\\build\\libs` folder to load the extension.\n\nAlternatively, you can skip the [Compilation](#1-compilation) step entirely and download the extension directly from the [BApp Store](https://portswigger.net/bappstore/6bf7574b632847faaaa4eb5e42f1757c).\n\n_Note: The version distributed on the [BApp Store](https://portswigger.net/bappstore/6bf7574b632847faaaa4eb5e42f1757c) might be lagging behind the version available on this repository._\n\n## Roadmap\n\n- [ ] Beautify the graphical user interface.\n- [ ] Deep parsing of `OpenAPI` schemas to collect all nested parameters along with their example/type.\n- [ ] Code simplification/refactoring.\n  - [ ] Use `MyHttpRequest` instead of `RequestWithMetadata`.\n- [x] Enable cells editing to change `API` calls directly from the `GUI`.\n- [ ] Fix the custom request editor tab to work properly with intercepted requests based on the match and replace rulesets.\n- [x] Further optimise the source code.\n- [ ] Implement support for authenticated testing (via user-supplied `API`-keys).\n- [x] Improve the `Param` column by adding parameters type (e.g. `inquery`, `inbody`).\n- [ ] Improve the tables and context menus.\n- [x] Increase the extension verbosity (via the bottom panel).\n\n## Project Information\n\nIn July 2016, after posting a request for improvement on the [PortSwigger support forum](https://support.portswigger.net/customer/portal/questions/16358278-swagger-parser-and-wsdler-improvement), I decided to take the initiative and to implement a solution myself.\n\nThe extension is still in development, feedback, comments and contributions are therefore much appreciated.\n\n## Sponsor \U0001F496\n\nIf this extension has saved you time and hassle during a security assessment, consider showing some love by sponsoring a cup of coffee ☕ for the developer. It's the fuel that powers development, after all. Just hit that shiny `Sponsor` button at the top of the page or [click here](https://github.com/sponsors/aress31) to contribute and keep the caffeine flowing. \U0001F4B8\n\n## Reporting Issues\n\nDid you find a bug?

  [Restish](https://rest.sh/) is a CLI for interacting with
  [REST](https://apisyouwonthate.com/blog/rest-and-hypermedia-in-2019)-ish HTTP
  APIs with some nice features built-in — like always having the latest API
  resources, fields, and operations available when they go live on the API
  without needing to install or update anything.

  Check out [how Restish compares to cURL &
  HTTPie](https://rest.sh/#/comparison).


  See the [user guide](https://rest.sh/#/guide) for how to install Restish and
  get started.


  Features include:


  - HTTP/2 ([RFC 7540](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540)) with TLS by
  _default_ with fallback to HTTP/1.1

  - Generic head/get/post/put/patch/delete verbs like `curl` or
  [HTTPie](https://httpie.org/)

  - Generated commands for CLI operations, e.g. `restish my-api list-users`
    - Automatically discovers API descriptions
      - [RFC 8631](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8631) `service-desc` link relation
      - [RFC 5988](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988#section-6.2.2) `describedby` link relation
    - Supported formats
      - OpenAPI [3.0](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.3.md) / [3.1](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0.html) and [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/)
    - Automatic configuration of API auth if advertised by the API
    - Shell command completion for Bash, Fish, Zsh, Powershell
  - Automatic pagination of resource collections via [RFC
  5988](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988) `prev` and `next` hypermedia links

  - API endpoint-based auth built-in with support for profiles:
    - HTTP Basic
    - API key via header or query param
    - OAuth2 client credentials flow (machine-to-machine, [RFC 6749](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749))
    - OAuth2 authorization code (with PKCE [RFC 7636](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636)) flow
    - On the fly authorization through external tools for custom API signature mechanisms
  - Content negotiation, decoding & unmarshalling built-in:
    - JSON ([RFC 8259](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259), <https://www.json.org/>)
    - YAML (<https://yaml.org/>)
    - CBOR ([RFC 7049](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7049), <http://cbor.io/>)

    - Amazon Ion (<http://amzn.github.io/ion-docs/>)
    - Gzip ([RFC 1952](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1952)), Deflate ([RFC 1951](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1951)), and Brotli ([RFC 7932](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7932)) content encoding
  - Standardized
  [hypermedia](https://smartbear.com/learn/api-design/what-is-hypermedia/)
  parsing into queryable/followable response links:
    - HTTP Link relation headers ([RFC 5988](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988#section-6.2.2))
    - [HAL](http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html)
    - [Siren](https://github.com/kevinswiber/siren)
    - [Terrifically Simple JSON](https://github.com/mpnally/Terrifically-Simple-JSON)
    - [JSON:API](https://jsonapi.org/)
  - Local caching that respects [RFC 7234](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234)
  `Cache-Control` and `Expires` headers

  - CLI
  [shorthand](https://github.com/danielgtaylor/openapi-cli-generator/tree/master/shorthand#cli-shorthand-syntax)

[Express.js](http://www.expressjs.com)\n\n## Installation\n\n```\nnpm i express-jsdoc-swagger\n```\n\n## Basic Usage\n\n```javascript\n// index.js file\nconst express = require('express');\nconst expressJSDocSwagger = require('express-jsdoc-swagger');\n\nconst options = {\n  info: {\n    version: '1.0.0',\n    title: 'Albums store',\n    license: {\n      name: 'MIT',\n    },\n  },\n  security: {\n    BasicAuth: {\n      type: 'http',\n      scheme: 'basic',\n    },\n  },\n  // Base directory which we use to locate your JSDOC files\n  baseDir: __dirname,\n  // Glob pattern to find your jsdoc files (multiple patterns can be added in an array)\n  filesPattern: './**/*.js',\n  // URL where SwaggerUI will be rendered\n  swaggerUIPath: '/api-docs',\n  // Expose OpenAPI UI\n  exposeSwaggerUI: true,\n  // Expose Open API JSON Docs documentation in `apiDocsPath` path.\n  exposeApiDocs: false,\n  // Open API JSON Docs endpoint.\n  apiDocsPath: '/v3/api-docs',\n  // Set non-required fields as nullable by default\n  notRequiredAsNullable: false,\n  // You can customize your UI options.\n  // you can extend swagger-ui-express config. You can checkout an example of this\n  // in the `example/configuration/swaggerOptions.js`\n  swaggerUiOptions: {},\n  // multiple option in case you want more that one instance\n  multiple: true,\n};\n\nconst app = express();\nconst PORT = 3000;\n\nexpressJSDocSwagger(app)(options);\n\n/**\n * GET /api/v1\n * @summary This is the summary of the endpoint\n * @return {object} 200 - success response\n */\napp.get('/api/v1', (req, res) => res.json({\n  success: true,\n}));\n\napp.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Example app listening at http://localhost:${PORT}`));\n```\n\n## Basic Examples\n\n1. Basic configuration options.\n\n```javascript\nconst options = {\n  info: {\n    version: '1.0.0',\n    title: 'Albums store',\n    license: {\n      name: 'MIT',\n    },\n  },\n  security: {\n    BasicAuth: {\n      type: 'http',\n      scheme: 'basic',\n    },\n  },\n  baseDir: __dirname,\n  // Glob pattern to find your jsdoc files (multiple patterns can be added in an array)\n  filesPattern: './**/*.js',\n};\n```\n\n2. Components definition\n\n```javascript\n/**\n * A song type\n * @typedef {object} Song\n * @property {string} title.required - The title\n * @property {string} artist - The artist\n * @property {number} year - The year - double\n */\n```\n\n3. Endpoint which returns a `Songs` model array in the response.\n\n```javascript\n/**\n * GET /api/v1/albums\n * @summary This is the summary of the endpoint\n * @tags album\n * @return {array<Song>} 200 - success response - application/json\n */\napp.get('/api/v1/albums', (req, res) => (\n  res.json([{\n    title: 'abum 1',\n  }])\n));\n```\n\n3. Endpoint PUT with body and path params which returns a `Songs` model array in the response.\n\n```javascript\n/**\n * PUT /api/v1/albums/{id}\n * @summary Update album\n * @tags album\n * @param {string} name.path - name param description\n * @param {Song} request.body.required - songs info\n * @return {array<Song>} 200 - success response - application/json\n */\napp.put('/api/v1/albums/:id', (req, res) => (\n  res.json([{\n    title: 'abum 1',\n  }])\n));\n```\n\n4. Basic endpoint definition with tags, params and basic authentication\n\n```javascript\n/**\n * GET /api/v1/album\n * @summary This is the summary of the endpoint\n * @security BasicAuth\n * @tags album\n * @param {string} name.query.required - name param description\n * @return {object} 200 - success response - application/json\n * @return {object} 400 - Bad request response\n */\napp.get('/api/v1/album', (req, res) => (\n  res.json({\n    title: 'abum 1',\n  })\n));\n```\n\n5. Basic endpoint definition with code example for response body\n\n```javascript\n/**\n * GET /api/v1/albums\n * @summary This is the summary of the endpoint\n * @tags album\n * @return {array<Song>} 200 - success response - application/json\n * @example response - 200 - success response example\n * [\n *   {\n *     \"title\": \"Bury the light\",\n *     \"artist\": \"Casey Edwards ft. Victor Borba\",\n *     \"year\": 2020\n *   }\n * ]\n */\napp.get('/api/v1/albums', (req, res) => (\n  res.json([{\n    title: 'track 1',\n  }])\n));\n```\n\nYou can find more examples [here](https://github.com/BRIKEV/express-jsdoc-swagger/tree/master/examples), or visit our [documentation](https://brikev.github.io/express-jsdoc-swagger-docs/#/).\n\n\n## Validator\n\nWe developed a new package works as a validator of your API endpoints and the documentation you create with this package. This package is [express-oas-validator](https://github.com/BRIKEV/express-oas-validator).\n\n**Example**\n\nInstall using the node package registry:\n\n```\nnpm install --save express-oas-validator\n```\n\nWe have to wait until we have the full swagger schema to initiate the validator.\n\n```js\n// validator.js\nconst { init } = require('express-oas-validator');\n\nconst validators = instance => new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n  instance.on('finish', (swaggerDef) => {\n    const { validateRequest, validateResponse } = init(swaggerDef);\n    resolve({ validateRequest, validateResponse });\n  });\n\n  instance.on('error', (error) => {\n    reject(error);\n  });\n});\n\nmodule.exports = validators;\n\n```\n\nYou can check out this also in our [example folder](https://github.com/BRIKEV/express-jsdoc-swagger/tree/master/examples/validator).\n\n```js\n// index.js\nconst express = require('express');\nconst expressJSDocSwagger = require('express-jsdoc-swagger');\nconst validator = require('./validator');\n\nconst options = {\n  info: {\n    version: '1.0.0',\n    title: 'Albums store',\n    license: {\n      name: 'MIT',\n    },\n  },\n  filesPattern: './**.js',\n  baseDir: __dirname,\n};\n\nconst app = express();\nconst instance = expressJSDocSwagger(app)(options);\n\nconst serverApp = async () => {\n  const { validateRequest, validateResponse } = await validator(instance);\n  app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));\n  app.use(express.json());\n  /**\n   * A song\n   * @typedef {object} Song\n   *

// Validate response\n      validateResponse('Error string', req);\n      return res.send('Hello World!');\n    } catch (error) {\n      return next(error);\n    }\n  });\n\n  /**\n   * GET

res.json([{\n      title: 'album 1',\n    }])\n  ));\n\n  // eslint-disable-next-line no-unused-vars\n  app.use((err, req, res, next) => {\n    res.status(err.status).json(err);\n  });\n\n  return app;\n};\n\nconst PORT = process.env.PORT || 4000;\n\nserverApp()\n  .then(app => \n    app.listen(PORT, () =>\n      console.log(`Listening PORT: ${PORT}`)\n    ))\n  .catch((err) => {\n

  | :mega: Calling for Maintainers |

  |--------------|

  | With the introduction of [ASP.NET Core](https://www.asp.net/core), I've now
  shifted my focus to the Core-specific project -
  [Swashbuckle.AspNetCore](https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle.AspNetCore).
  That will be receiving most of my (already limited) personal time, and so I
  won't have the capacity to maintain this one at a sufficient rate. Still, I'd
  love to see it live on and am seeking one or two "core" contributors /
  maintainers to help out. Ideally, these would be people who have already
  contributed through PRs and understand the inner workings and overall design.
  Once signed-up, we can agree on an approach that works - ultimately, I want to
  remove myself as the bottleneck to merging PRs and getting fresh Nugets
  published. If you're interested, please let me know by adding a comment
  [here](https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle/issues/1053) |


  Swashbuckle

  =========


  [![Build
  status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/qoesh4nm6tb6diuk?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/domaindrivendev/swashbuckle)


  Seamlessly adds a [Swagger](http://swagger.io/) to WebApi projects! Combines
  ApiExplorer and Swagger/swagger-ui to provide a rich discovery, documentation
  and playground experience to your API consumers.


  In addition to its Swagger generator, Swashbuckle also contains an embedded
  version of [swagger-ui](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui) which it
  will automatically serve up once Swashbuckle is installed. This means you can
  complement your API with a slick discovery UI to assist consumers with their
  integration efforts. Best of all, it requires minimal coding and maintenance,
  allowing you to focus on building an awesome API!


  And that's not all ...


  Once you have a Web API that can describe itself in Swagger, you've opened the
  treasure chest of Swagger-based tools including a client generator that can be
  targeted to a wide range of popular platforms. See
  [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) for more
  details.


  **Swashbuckle Core Features:**


  * Auto-generated [Swagger
  2.0](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md)

  * Seamless integration of swagger-ui

  * Reflection-based Schema generation for describing API types

  * Extensibility hooks for customizing the generated Swagger doc

  * Extensibility hooks for customizing the swagger-ui

  * Out-of-the-box support for leveraging Xml comments

  * Support for describing ApiKey, Basic Auth and OAuth2 schemes ... including
  UI support for the Implicit OAuth2 flow


  **Swashbuckle 5.0**


  Swashbuckle 5.0 makes the transition to Swagger 2.0. The 2.0 schema is
  significantly different to its predecessor (1.2) and, as a result, the
  Swashbuckle config interface has undergone yet another overhaul. Checkout the
  [transition guide](#transitioning-to-swashbuckle-50) if you're upgrading from
  a prior version.


  ## Getting Started ##


  There are currently two Nuget packages - the Core library (Swashbuckle.Core)
  and a convenience package (Swashbuckle)  - that provides automatic
  bootstrapping. The latter is only applicable to regular IIS hosted Web APIs.
  For all other hosting environments, you should only install the Core library
  and then follow the instructions below to manually enable the Swagger routes.


  Once installed and enabled, you should be able to browse the following Swagger
  docs and UI endpoints respectively:


  ***\<your-root-url\>/swagger/docs/v1***


  ***\<your-root-url\>/swagger***


  ### IIS Hosted ###


  If your service is hosted in IIS, you can start exposing Swagger docs and a
  corresponding swagger-ui by simply installing the following Nuget package:

      Install-Package Swashbuckle

  This will add a reference to Swashbuckle.Core and also install a bootstrapper
  (App_Start/SwaggerConfig.cs) that enables the Swagger routes on app start-up
  using [WebActivatorEx](https://github.com/davidebbo/WebActivator).


  ### Self-hosted ###


  If your service is self-hosted, just install the Core library:

      Install-Package Swashbuckle.Core

  Then manually enable the Swagger docs and, optionally, the swagger-ui by
  invoking the following extension methods (in namespace
  Swashbuckle.Application) on an instance of HttpConfiguration (e.g. in
  Program.cs)


  ```csharp

  httpConfiguration
       .EnableSwagger(c => c.SingleApiVersion("v1", "A title for your API"))
       .EnableSwaggerUi();
  ```


  ### OWIN  ###


  If your service is hosted using OWIN middleware, just install the Core
  library:

      Install-Package Swashbuckle.Core

  Then manually enable the Swagger docs and swagger-ui by invoking the extension
  methods (in namespace Swashbuckle.Application) on an instance of
  HttpConfiguration (e.g. in Startup.cs)


  ```csharp

  httpConfiguration
      .EnableSwagger(c => c.SingleApiVersion("v1", "A title for your API"))
      .EnableSwaggerUi();    
  ```


  ## Troubleshooting ##


  Troubleshooting??? I thought this was all supposed to be "seamless"? OK you've
  called me out! Things shouldn't go wrong, but if they do, take a look at the
  [FAQs](#troubleshooting-and-faqs) for inspiration.


  ## Customizing the Generated Swagger Docs ##


  The following snippet demonstrates the minimum configuration required to get
  the Swagger docs and swagger-ui up and running:

  ```csharp

  httpConfiguration
        .EnableSwagger(c => c.SingleApiVersion("v1", "A title for your API"))
        .EnableSwaggerUi();
  ```


  These methods expose a range of configuration and extensibility options that
  you can pick and choose from, combining the convenience of sensible defaults
  with the flexibility to customize where you see fit. Read on to learn more.


  ### Custom Routes ###


  The default route templates for the Swagger docs and swagger-ui are
  "swagger/docs/{apiVersion}" and "swagger/ui/{\*assetPath}" respectively.
  You're free to change these so long as the provided templates include the
  relevant route parameters - {apiVersion} and {\*assetPath}.


  ```csharp

  httpConfiguration
      .EnableSwagger("docs/{apiVersion}/swagger", c => c.SingleApiVersion("v1", "A title for your API"))
      .EnableSwaggerUi("sandbox/{*assetPath}");
  ```


  In this case the URL to swagger-ui will be `sandbox/index`.


  ### Pretty Print ###


  If you want the output Swagger docs to be indented properly, enable the
  __PrettyPrint__ option as following:


  ```cs

  httpConfiguration
      .EnableSwagger(c => c.PrettyPrint())
      .EnableSwaggerUi();
  ```


  ### Additional Service Metadata ###


  In addition to operation descriptions, Swagger 2.0 includes several properties
  to describe the service itself. These can all be provided through the
  configuration API:


  ```csharp

  httpConfiguration
      .EnableSwagger(c =>
          {
              c.RootUrl(req => GetRootUrlFromAppConfig());

              c.Schemes(new[] { "http", "https" });

              c.SingleApiVersion("v1", "Swashbuckle.Dummy")
                  .Description("A sample API for testing and prototyping Swashbuckle features")
                  .TermsOfService("Some terms")
                  .Contact(cc => cc
                      .Name("Some contact")
                      .Url("http://tempuri.org/contact")
                      .Email("some.contact@tempuri.org"))
                  .License(lc => lc
                      .Name("Some License")
                      .Url("http://tempuri.org/license"));
          });
  ```

  #### RootUrl ####


  By default, the service root url is inferred from the request used to access
  the docs. However, there may be situations (e.g. proxy and load-balanced
  environments) where this does not resolve correctly. You can workaround this
  by providing your own code to determine the root URL.


  #### Schemes ####


  If schemes are not explicitly provided in a Swagger 2.0 document, then the
  scheme used to access the docs is taken as the default. If your API supports
  multiple schemes and you want to be explicit about them, you can use the
  __Schemes__ option.


  #### SingleApiVersion ####


  Use this to describe a single version API. Swagger 2.0 includes an "Info"
  object to hold additional metadata for an API. Version and title are required
  but you may also provide additional fields as shown above.


  __NOTE__: If your Web API is hosted in IIS, you should avoid using full-stops
  in the version name (e.g. "1.0"). The full-stop at the tail of the URL will
  cause IIS to treat it as a static file (i.e. with an extension) and bypass the
  URL Routing Module and therefore, Web API. 


  ### Describing Multiple API Versions ###


  If your API has multiple versions, use __MultipleApiVersions__ instead of
  __SingleApiVersion__. In this case, you provide a lambda that tells
  Swashbuckle which actions should be included in the docs for a given API
  version. Like __SingleApiVersion__, __Version__ also returns an "Info" builder
  so you can provide additional metadata per API version.


  ```csharp

  httpConfiguration
      .EnableSwagger(c =>
          {
              c.MultipleApiVersions(
                  (apiDesc, targetApiVersion) => ResolveVersionSupportByRouteConstraint(apiDesc, targetApiVersion),
                  (vc) =>
                  {
                      vc.Version("v2", "Swashbuckle Dummy API V2");
                      vc.Version("v1", "Swashbuckle Dummy API V1");
                  });
          });
      .EnableSwaggerUi(c =>
          {
              c.EnableDiscoveryUrlSelector();
          });
  ```


  \* You can also enable a select box in the swagger-ui (as shown above) that
  displays a discovery URL for each version. This provides a convenient way for
  users to browse documentation for different API versions.


  ### Describing Security/Authorization Schemes ###


  You can use BasicAuth, __ApiKey__ or __OAuth2__ options to describe security
  schemes for the API. See
  https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md for
  more details.


  ```csharp

  httpConfiguration
       .EnableSwagger(c =>
           {
               //c.BasicAuth("basic")
               //    .Description("Basic HTTP Authentication");

               //c.ApiKey("apiKey")
               //    .Description("API Key Authentication")
               //    .Name("apiKey")
               //    .In("header");

               c.OAuth2("oauth2")
                   .Description("OAuth2 Implicit Grant")
                   .Flow("implicit")
                   .AuthorizationUrl("http://petstore.swagger.wordnik.com/api/oauth/dialog")
                   //.TokenUrl("https://tempuri.org/token")
                   .Scopes(scopes =>
                   {
                       scopes.Add("read", "Read access to protected resources");
                       scopes.Add("write", "Write access to protected resources");
                   });

               c.OperationFilter<AssignOAuth2SecurityRequirements>();
           });
       .EnableSwaggerUi(c =>
           {
               c.EnableOAuth2Support("test-client-id", "test-realm", "Swagger UI");
           });
  ```

  __NOTE:__ These only define the schemes and need to be coupled with a
  corresponding "security" property at the document or operation level to
  indicate which schemes are required for each operation.  To do this, you'll
  need to implement a custom IDocumentFilter and/or IOperationFilter to set
  these properties according to your specific authorization implementation


  \* If your API supports the OAuth2 Implicit flow, and you've described it
  correctly, according to the Swagger 2.0 specification, you can enable UI
  support as shown above.


  ### Customize the Operation Listing ###


  If necessary, you can ignore obsolete actions and provide custom
  grouping/sorting strategies for the list of Operations in a Swagger document:


  ```csharp

  httpConfiguration
      .EnableSwagger(c =>
          {
              c.IgnoreObsoleteActions();

              c.GroupActionsBy(apiDesc => apiDesc.HttpMethod.ToString());

              c.OrderActionGroupsBy(new DescendingAlphabeticComparer());
          });
  ```

  #### IgnoreObsoleteActions ####


  Set this flag to omit operation descriptions for any actions decorated with
  the Obsolete attribute


  __NOTE__: If you want to omit specific operations but without using the
  Obsolete attribute, you can create an IDocumentFilter or make use of the built
  in ApiExplorerSettingsAttribute


  #### GroupActionsBy ####


  Each operation can be assigned one or more tags which are then used by
  consumers for various reasons. For example, the swagger-ui groups operations
  according to the first tag of each operation. By default, this will be the
  controller name but you can use this method to override with any value.


  #### OrderActionGroupsBy ####


  You can also specify a custom sort order for groups (as defined by
  __GroupActionsBy__) to dictate the order in which operations are listed. For
  example, if the default grouping is in place (controller name) and you specify
  a descending alphabetic sort order, then actions from a ProductsController
  will be listed before those from a CustomersController. This is typically used
  to customize the order of groupings in the swagger-ui.


  ### Modifying Generated Schemas ###


  Swashbuckle makes a best attempt at generating Swagger compliant JSON schemas
  for the various types exposed in your API. However, there may be occasions
  when more control of the output is needed.  This is supported through the
  following options:


  ```csharp

  httpConfiguration
        .EnableSwagger(c =>
            {
                c.MapType<ProductType>(() => new Schema { type = "integer", format = "int32" });

                c.SchemaFilter<ApplySchemaVendorExtensions>();

                //c.UseFullTypeNameInSchemaIds();

                c.SchemaId(t => t.FullName.Contains('`') ? t.FullName.Substring(0, t.FullName.IndexOf('`')) : t.FullName);
                
                c.IgnoreObsoleteProperties();

                c.DescribeAllEnumsAsStrings();
            });
  ```


  #### MapType ####


  Use this option to override the Schema generation for a specific type.


  It should be noted that the resulting Schema will be placed "inline" for any
  applicable Operations. While Swagger 2.0 supports inline definitions for "all"
  Schema types, the swagger-ui tool does not. It expects "complex" Schemas to be
  defined separately and referenced. For this reason, you should only use the
  __MapType__ option when the resulting Schema is a primitive or array type.


  If you need to alter a complex Schema, use a Schema filter.


  #### SchemaFilter ####


  If you want to post-modify "complex" Schemas once they've been generated,
  across the board or for a specific type, you can wire up one or more Schema
  filters.


  ISchemaFilter has the following interface:


  ```csharp

  void Apply(Schema schema, SchemaRegistry schemaRegistry, Type type);

  ```


  A typical implementation will inspect the system Type and modify the Schema
  accordingly. If necessary, the schemaRegistry can be used to obtain or
  register Schemas for other Types


  #### UseFullTypeNamesInSchemaIds ####


  In a Swagger 2.0 document, complex types are typically declared globally and
  referenced by unique Schema Id. By default, Swashbuckle does NOT use the full
  type name in Schema Ids. In most cases, this works well because it prevents
  the "implementation detail" of type namespaces from leaking into your Swagger
  docs and UI. However, if you have multiple types in your API with the same
  class name, you'll need to opt out of this behavior to avoid Schema Id
  conflicts.  


  #### SchemaId ####


  Use this option to provide your own custom strategy for inferring SchemaId's
  for describing "complex" types in your API.


  #### IgnoreObsoleteProperties ####


  Set this flag to omit schema property descriptions for any type properties
  decorated with the Obsolete attribute 


  #### DescribeAllEnumsAsStrings ####


  In accordance with the built in JsonSerializer, Swashbuckle will, by default,
  describe enums as integers. You can change the serializer behavior by
  configuring the StringEnumConverter globally or for a given enum type.
  Swashbuckle will honor this change out-of-the-box. However, if you use a
  different approach to serialize enums as strings, you can also force
  Swashbuckle to describe them as strings.


  ### Modifying Generated Operations ###


  Similar to Schema filters, Swashbuckle also supports Operation and Document
  filters:


  ```csharp

  httpConfiguration
       .EnableSwagger(c => c.SingleApiVersion("v1", "A title for your API"))
           {
               c.OperationFilter<AddDefaultResponse>();

               c.DocumentFilter<ApplyDocumentVendorExtensions>();
           });
  ```

  #### OperationFilter ####


  Post-modify Operation descriptions once they've been generated by wiring up
  one or more Operation filters.


  IOperationFilter has the following interface:


  ```csharp

  void Apply(Operation operation, SchemaRegistry schemaRegistry, ApiDescription
  apiDescription);

  ```


  A typical implementation will inspect the ApiDescription and modify the
  Operation accordingly. If necessary, the schemaRegistry can be used to obtain
  or register Schemas for Types that are used in the Operation.


  #### DocumentFilter ####


  Post-modify the entire Swagger document by wiring up one or more Document
  filters.


  IDocumentFilter has the following interface:


  ```csharp

  void Apply(SwaggerDocument swaggerDoc, SchemaRegistry schemaRegistry,
  IApiExplorer apiExplorer);

  ```


  This gives full control to modify the final SwaggerDocument. You can gain
  additional context from the provided SwaggerDocument (e.g. version) and
  IApiExplorer. You should have a good understanding of the [Swagger 2.0
  spec.](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md)
  before using this option.


  ### Wrapping the SwaggerGenerator with Additional Behavior ###


  The default implementation of ISwaggerProvider, the interface used to obtain
  Swagger metadata for a given API, is the SwaggerGenerator. If neccessary, you
  can inject your own implementation or wrap the existing one with additional
  behavior. For example, you could use this option to inject a "Caching Proxy"
  that attempts to retrieve the SwaggerDocument from a cache before delegating
  to the built-in generator:


  ```csharp

  httpConfiguration
        .EnableSwagger(c => c.SingleApiVersion("v1", "A title for your API"))
            {
          c.CustomProvider((defaultProvider) => new CachingSwaggerProvider(defaultProvider));
            });
  ```


  ### Including XML Comments ###


  If you annotate Controllers and API Types with [Xml
  Comments](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/b2s063f7(v=vs.110).aspx),
  you can incorporate those comments into the generated docs and UI. The Xml
  tags are mapped to Swagger properties as follows:


  * **Action summary** -> Operation.summary

  * **Action remarks** -> Operation.description

  * **Parameter summary** -> Parameter.description

  * **Type summary** -> Schema.descripton

  * **Property summary** -> Schema.description (i.e. on a property Schema)


  You can enable this by providing the path to one or more XML comments files:

  ```csharp

  httpConfiguration
      .EnableSwagger(c =>
          {
              c.SingleApiVersion("v1", "A title for your API");
              c.IncludeXmlComments(GetXmlCommentsPathForControllers());
              c.IncludeXmlComments(GetXmlCommentsPathForModels());
          });
  ```


  NOTE: You will need to enable output of the XML documentation file. This is
  enabled by going to project properties -> Build -> Output. The "XML
  documentation file" needs to be checked and a path assigned, such as
  "bin\Debug\MyProj.XML". You will also want to verify this across each build
  configuration. Here's an example of reading the file, but it may need to be
  modified according to your specific project settings:


  ```csharp

  httpConfiguration
      .EnableSwagger(c =>
          {
              var baseDirectory = AppDomain.CurrentDomain.BaseDirectory;
              var commentsFileName = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().GetName().Name + ".XML";
              var commentsFile = Path.Combine(baseDirectory, commentsFileName);

              c.SingleApiVersion("v1", "A title for your API");
              c.IncludeXmlComments(commentsFile);
              c.IncludeXmlComments(GetXmlCommentsPathForModels());
          });
  ```

  #### Response Codes ####


  Swashbuckle will automatically create a "success" response for each operation
  based on the action's return type. If it's a void, the status code will be 204
  (No content), otherwise 200 (Ok). This mirrors WebApi's default behavior. If
  you need to change this and/or list additional response codes, you can use the
  non-standard "response" tag:


  ```csharp

  /// <response code="201">Account created</response>

  /// <response code="400">Username already in use</response>

  public int Create(Account account)

  ```

  ### Working Around Swagger 2.0 Constraints ###


  In contrast to Web API, Swagger 2.0 does not include the query string
  component when mapping a URL to an action. As a result, Swashbuckle will raise
  an exception if it encounters multiple actions with the same path (sans query
  string) and HTTP method. You can workaround this by providing a custom
  strategy to pick a winner or merge the descriptions for the purposes of the
  Swagger docs 


  ```csharp

  httpConfiguration
      .EnableSwagger((c) =>
          {
              c.SingleApiVersion("v1", "A title for your API"));
              c.ResolveConflictingActions(apiDescriptions => apiDescriptions.First());
          });
  ```

  See the following discussion for more details:


  <https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle/issues/142>


  ## Customizing the swagger-ui ##


  The swagger-ui is a JavaScript application hosted in a single HTML page
  (index.html), and it exposes several customization settings. Swashbuckle ships
  with an embedded version and includes corresponding configuration methods for
  each of the UI settings. If you require further customization, you can also
  inject your own version of "index.html". Read on to learn more.


  ### Customizations via the configuration API ###


  If you're happy with the basic look and feel but want to make some minor
  tweaks, the following options may be sufficient:


  ```csharp

  httpConfiguration
      .EnableSwagger(c => c.SingleApiVersion("v1", "A title for your API"))
      .EnableSwaggerUi(c =>
          {
              c.InjectStylesheet(containingAssembly, "Swashbuckle.Dummy.SwaggerExtensions.testStyles1.css");
              c.InjectJavaScript(containingAssembly, "Swashbuckle.Dummy.SwaggerExtensions.testScript1.js");
              c.SetValidatorUrl("http://localhost/validator");
              c.DisableValidator();
              c.DocExpansion(DocExpansion.List);
              c.SupportedSubmitMethods("GET", "HEAD")
          });
  ```


  #### InjectStylesheet ####


  Use this to enrich the UI with one or more additional CSS stylesheets. The
  file(s) must be included in your project as an "Embedded Resource", and then
  the resource's "Logical Name" is passed to the method as shown above. See
  [Injecting Custom Content](#injecting-custom-content) for step by step
  instructions.


  #### InjectJavaScript ####


  Use this to invoke one or more custom JavaScripts after the swagger-ui has
  loaded. The file(s) must be included in your project as an "Embedded
  Resource", and then the resource's "Logical Name" is passed to the method as
  shown above. See [Injecting Custom Content](#injecting-custom-content) for
  step by step instructions.


  #### SetValidatorUrl/DisableValidator ####


  By default, swagger-ui will validate specs against swagger.io's online
  validator and display the result in a badge at the bottom of the page. Use
  these options to set a different validator URL or to disable the feature
  entirely.


  #### DocExpansion ####


  Use this option to control how the Operation listing is displayed. It can be
  set to "None" (default), "List" (shows operations for each resource), or
  "Full" (fully expanded: shows operations and their details).


  #### SupportedSubmitMethods ####


  Specify which HTTP operations will have the 'Try it out!' option. An empty
  parameter list disables it for all operations.


  ### Provide your own "index" file ###


  As an alternative, you can inject your own version of "index.html" and
  customize the markup and swagger-ui directly. Use the __CustomAsset__ option
  to instruct Swashbuckle to return your version instead of the default when a
  request is made for "index". As with all custom content, the file must be
  included in your project as an "Embedded Resource", and then the resource's
  "Logical Name" is passed to the method as shown below. See [Injecting Custom
  Content](#injecting-custom-content) for step by step instructions.


  For compatibility, you should base your custom "index.html" off [this
  version](https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle/blob/v5.5.3/Swashbuckle.Core/SwaggerUi/CustomAssets/index.html)


  ```csharp

  httpConfiguration
       .EnableSwagger(c => c.SingleApiVersion("v1", "A title for your API"))
       .EnableSwaggerUi(c =>
           {
               c.CustomAsset("index", yourAssembly, "YourWebApiProject.SwaggerExtensions.index.html");
           });
  ```


  ### Injecting Custom Content ###


  The __InjectStylesheet__, __InjectJavaScript__ and __CustomAsset__ options all
  share the same mechanism for providing custom content. In each case, the file
  must be included in your project as an "Embedded Resource". The steps to do
  this are described below:


  1. Add a new file to your Web API project.

  2. In Solution Explorer, right click the file and open its properties window.
  Change the "Build Action" to "Embedded Resource".


  This will embed the file in your assembly and register it with a "Logical
  Name". This can then be passed to the relevant configuration method. It's
  based on the Project's default namespace, file location and file extension.
  For example, given a default namespace of "YourWebApiProject" and a file
  located at "/SwaggerExtensions/index.html", then the resource will be assigned
  the name - "YourWebApiProject.SwaggerExtensions.index.html". If you use
  "Swagger" as the root folder name for your custom assets, this will collide
  with the default route templates and the page will not be loaded correctly.


  ## Transitioning to Swashbuckle 5.0 ##


  This version of Swashbuckle makes the transition to Swagger 2.0. The 2.0
  specification is significantly different to its predecessor (1.2) and forces
  several breaking changes to Swashbuckle's configuration API. If you're using
  Swashbuckle without any customizations, i.e. App_Start/SwaggerConfig.cs has
  never been modified, then you can overwrite it with the new version. The
  defaults are the same and so the swagger-ui should behave as before.


  \* If you have consumers of the raw Swagger document, you should ensure they
  can accept Swagger 2.0 before making the upgrade.


  If you're using the existing configuration API to customize the final Swagger
  document and/or swagger-ui, you will need to port the code manually. The
  static __Customize__ methods on SwaggerSpecConfig and SwaggerUiConfig have
  been replaced with extension methods on HttpConfiguration - __EnableSwagger__
  and __EnableSwaggerUi__. All options from version 4.0 are made available
  through these methods, albeit with slightly different naming and syntax. Refer
  to the tables below for a summary of changes:



  | 4.0 | 5.0 Equivalent | Additional Notes |

  | --------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |

  | ResolveBasePathUsing | RootUrl | |

  | ResolveTargetVersionUsing | N/A | version is now implicit in the docs URL
  e.g. "swagger/docs/{apiVersion}" |

  | ApiVersion | SingleApiVersion| now supports additional metadata for the
  version | 

  | SupportMultipleApiVersions | MultipleApiVersions | now supports additional
  metadata for each version |

  | Authorization | BasicAuth/ApiKey/OAuth2 | | 

  | GroupDeclarationsBy | GroupActionsBy | |

  | SortDeclarationsBy | OrderActionGroupsBy | |

  | MapType | MapType | now accepts Func&lt;Schema&gt; instead of
  Func&lt;DataType&gt; |

  | ModelFilter | SchemaFilter | IModelFilter is now ISchemaFilter,
  DataTypeRegistry is now SchemaRegistry |

  | OperationFilter | OperationFilter | DataTypeRegistry is now SchemaRegistry |

  | PolymorphicType | N/A | not currently supported |

  | SupportHeaderParams | N/A | header params are implicitly supported |

  | SupportedSubmitMethods | N/A | all HTTP verbs are implicitly supported |

  | CustomRoute | CustomAsset | &nbsp; |

  ### Swagger-ui showing "Can't read swagger JSON from ..."


  If you see this message, it means the swagger-ui received an unexpected
  response when requesting the Swagger document. You can troubleshoot further by
  navigating directly to the discovery URL included in the error message. This
  should provide more details.


  If the discovery URL returns a 404 Not Found response, it may be due to a
  full-stop in the version name (e.g. "1.0"). This will cause IIS to treat it as
  a static file (i.e. with an extension) and bypass the URL Routing Module and
  therefore, Web API. 


  To workaround, you can update the version name specified in SwaggerConfig.cs.
  For example, to "v1", "1-0" etc. Alternatively, you can change the route
  template being used for the swagger docs (as shown [here](#custom-routes)) so
  that the version parameter is not at the end of the route.


  ### Page not found when accessing the UI ###


  Swashbuckle serves an embedded version of the swagger-ui through the Web API
  pipeline. But, most of the URLs contain extensions (.html, .js, .css) and many
  IIS environments are configured to bypass the managed pipeline for paths
  containing extensions.


  In previous versions of Swashbuckle, this was resolved by adding the following
  setting to your Web.config:


  ```xml

  <system.webServer>
    <modules runAllManagedModulesForAllRequests="true" />
  </system.webServer>

  ```


  This is no longer neccessary in Swashbuckle 5.0 because it serves the
  swagger-ui through extensionless URL's.


  However, if you're using the SingleApiVersion, MultipleApiVersions or
  CustomAsset configuration settings you could still get this error. Check to
  ensure you're not specifying a value that causes a URL with an extension to be
  referenced in the UI. For example a full-stop in a version number ...


  ```csharp

  httpConfiguration
      .EnableSwagger(c => c.SingleApiVersion("1.0", "A title for your API"))
      .EnableSwaggerUi();
  ```

  will result in a discovery URL like this "/swagger/docs/1.0" where the
  full-stop is treated as a file extension.


  ### Swagger-ui broken by Visual Studio 2013 ###


  VS 2013 ships with a new feature - Browser Link - that improves the web
  development workflow by setting up a channel between the IDE and pages being
  previewed in a local browser. It does this by dynamically injecting JavaScript
  into your files.


  Although this JavaScript SHOULD have no affect on your production code, it
  appears to be breaking the swagger-ui.


  I hope to find a permanent fix, but in the meantime, you'll need to workaround
  this issue by disabling the feature in your web.config:


  ```xml

  <appSettings>
      <add key="vs:EnableBrowserLink" value="false"/>
  </appSettings>

  ```

  ### OWIN Hosted in IIS - Incorrect VirtualPathRoot Handling


  When you host Web API 2 on top of OWIN/SystemWeb, Swashbuckle cannot correctly
  resolve VirtualPathRoot by default.


  You must either explicitly set VirtualPathRoot in your HttpConfiguration at
  startup, or perform customization like this to fix automatic discovery:


  ```csharp

  httpConfiguration.EnableSwagger(c => 

  {
      c.RootUrl(req =>
          req.RequestUri.GetLeftPart(UriPartial.Authority) +
          req.GetRequestContext().VirtualPathRoot.TrimEnd('/'));
  }

  ```


  ### How to add vendor extensions


  Swagger 2.0 allows additional meta-data (aka vendor extensions) to be added at
  various points in the Swagger document. Swashbuckle supports this by including
  a "vendorExtensions" dictionary with each of the extensible Swagger types.
  Meta-data can be added to these dictionaries from custom Schema, Operation or
  Document filters. For example:


  ```csharp

  public class ApplySchemaVendorExtensions : ISchemaFilter

  {
      public void Apply(Schema schema, SchemaRegistry schemaRegistry, Type type)
      {
          schema.vendorExtensions.Add("x-foo", "bar");
      }
  }

  ```


  As per the specification, all extension properties should be prefixed by "x-"


  ### FromUri Query string DataMember names are incorrect


  When using `FromUri` Model Binding, it is possible to override the querystring
  parameter name's using `DataMember`s. In this case you can add a custom
  operation filter to override the name. For example:


  ```csharp

  public class ComplexTypeOperationFilter : IOperationFilter

  {
      public void Apply(Operation operation, SchemaRegistry schemaRegistry, ApiDescription apiDescription)
      {
          if (operation.parameters == null)
              return;

          var parameters = apiDescription.ActionDescriptor.GetParameters();
          foreach (var parameter in parameters)
          {
              foreach (var property in parameter.ParameterType.GetProperties())
              {
                  var param = operation.parameters.FirstOrDefault(o => o.name.ToLowerInvariant().Contains(property.Name.ToLowerInvariant()));

                  if (param == null) continue;

                  var name = GetNameFromAttribute(property);

                  if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(name))
                  {
                      operation.parameters.Remove(param);
                  }
                  param.name = GetNameFromAttribute(property);
              }
          }
      }
      
      private static string GetNameFromAttribute(PropertyInfo property)
      {
          var customAttributes = property.GetCustomAttributes(typeof(DataMemberAttribute), true);
          if (customAttributes.Length > 0)
          {
              var attribute = customAttributes[0] as DataMemberAttribute;
              if (attribute != null) return attribute.Name;
          }
          return string.Empty;
      }
  }

  ```


  ### Remove Duplicate Path Parameters


  When using `FromUri` Model Binding, duplicate items can appear as items can be
  passed as URI parameters, or querystrings. In this case you can add a custom
  operation filter to remove the duplicates. For example:


  ```csharp

  public class ComplexTypeOperationFilter : IOperationFilter

  {
      public void Apply(Operation operation, SchemaRegistry schemaRegistry, ApiDescription apiDescription)
      {
         if (operation.parameters == null)
             return;
         var complexParameters = operation.parameters.Where(x => x.@in == "query" && !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(x.name)).ToArray();

         foreach (var parameter in complexParameters)
         {
             if (!parameter.name.Contains('.')) continue;
             var name = parameter.name.Split('.')[1];

             var opParams = operation.parameters.Where(x => x.name == name);
             var parameters = opParams as Parameter[] ?? opParams.ToArray();

             if (parameters.Length > 0)
             {
                 operation.parameters.Remove(parameter);
             }
         }
      }
  }

  ```


  ### Deploying behind Load Balancer / Reverse Proxies


  Swashbuckle attempts to populate the [Swagger
  "host"](http://swagger.io/specification/#swaggerObject) property from HTTP
  headers that are sent with the request for Swagger JSON. This may cause issues
  in load balancer / reverse proxy environments, particularly if non-standard
  headers are used to pass on the outer most host name. You can workaround this
  by providing your own function for determining your API's root URL based on
  vendor-specific headers. Checkout [issue
  705](https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle/issues/705) for some
  potential implementations.


  ### 500 : {"Message":"An error has occurred."}


  If, on loading the Swagger UI page, you get an error: `500 : {"Message":"An
  error has occurred."} http://<url>/swagger/docs/v1` ensure that the XML
  documentation output settings have been set in the project file in the
  solution, for both Debug and Release configurations.

cellular/oazapfts: "# \U0001F37B oazapfts!\n\n[![CI](https://github.com/cellular/oazapfts/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cellular/oazapfts/actions/workflows/ci.yml)\n\nGenerate TypeScript clients to tap into OpenAPI servers.\n\n![](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/119607625?s=200&v=4)\n\n## Features\n\n- **AST-based**:\n  Unlike other code generators `oazapfts` does not use templates to generate code but uses TypeScript's built-in API to generate and pretty-print an abstract syntax tree.\n- **Fast**: The CLI does not use any of the common Java-based tooling, so the code generation is super fast.\n- **Single file**: All functions and types are co-located in one single self-contained file.\n- **Tree-shakeable**: Individually exported functions allow you to bundle only the ones you actually use.\n- **Human friendly signatures**: The generated API methods don't leak any HTTP-specific implementation details. For example, all optional parameters are grouped together in one object, no matter whether they end up in the headers, path or query-string.\n\n## Installation\n\n```\nnpm install oazapfts\n```\n\n> **Note**\n> With version 3.0.0 oazapfts has become a runtime dependency and the generated code does no longer include all the fetch logic.\n\n## Usage\n\n```\noazapfts <spec> [filename]\n\nOptions:\n--exclude, -e tag to exclude\n--include, -i tag to include\n--optimistic\n--useEnumType\n```\n\nWhere `<spec>` is the URL or local path of an OpenAPI or Swagger spec (in either json or yml) and `<filename>` is the location of the `.ts` file to be generated. If the filename is omitted, the code is written to stdout.\n\n### Options\n\n- `--optimistic` generare a client in [optimistic mode](#optimistic-mode)\n\n- `--useEnumType` generate enums instead of union types\n\n## Consuming the generated API\n\nFor each operation defined in the spec the generated API will export a function with a name matching the `operationId`. If no ID is specified, a reasonable name is generated from the HTTP verb and the path.\n\n```ts\nimport * as api from \"./my-generated-api.ts\";\nconst res = api.getPetById(1);\n```\n\n> **Note**\n> If your API is large, and you want to take advantage of tree-shaking to exclude unused code, use individual named imports instead:\n\n```ts\nimport { getPetById } from \"./my-generated-api.ts\";\n```\n\n## Fetch options\n\nThe **last argument** of each function is an optional [`RequestOpts`](https://github.com/oazapfts/oazapfts/blob/27b296c6fc28fec4869f1b7e1a4a5585ebbd5ee9/src/runtime/index.ts#L5) object that can be used to pass options to the `fetch` call, for example to pass additional `headers` or an `AbortSignal` to cancel the request later on.\n\n```ts\nconst res = getPetById(1, {\n  credentials: \"include\",\n  headers: {\n    Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,\n  },\n});\n```\n\nYou can also use this to override the default `baseUrl` or to provide a custom `fetch` implementation.\n\n> **Note**\n> Instead of passing custom options to each function call, consider [overwriting the global defaults](#overriding-the-defaults).\n\n## Optimistic vs. explicit responses\n\nOazapfts supports two different modes to handle results,\nan [explicit](#explicit-mode) mode (the default) and an [optimistic](#optimistic-mode) mode, that makes the response handling less verbose.\n\n## Explicit mode\n\nBy default, each function returns an `ApiResponse` object that exposes the `status` code, response `headers` and the `data`.\n\n> **Note**\n> This mode is best suited for APIs that return different types for different response codes or APIs where you need to access not only the response body, but also the response headers. If your API is simple, and you don't need this flexibility, consider using the [optimistic mode](#optimistic-mode) instead.\n\nIn explicit mode, each function returns a Promise for an `ApiResponse` which is an object with a `status` and a `data` property, holding the HTTP status code and the properly typed data from the response body.\n\nSince an operation can return different types depending on the status code, the actual return type is a _union_ of all possible responses, discriminated by their status.\n\nConsider the following code generated from the `petstore.json` example:\n\n```ts\n/**\n * Find pet by ID\n */\nexport function getPetById(petId: number, opts?: Oazapfts.RequestOpts) {\n  return oazapfts.fetchJson<\n    | {\n        status: 200;\n        data: Pet;\n      }\n    | {\n        status: 400;\n        data: string;\n      }\n    | {\n        status: 404;\n      }\n  >(`/pet/${encodeURIComponent(petId)}`, {\n    ...opts,\n  });\n}\n```\n\nIn this case, the `data` property is typed as `Pet|string`. We can use a type guard to narrow down the type to `Pet`:\n\n```ts\nconst res = await api.getPetById(1);\nif (res.status === 200) {\n  const pet = res.data;\n  // pet is properly typed as Pet\n}\nif (res.status === 404) {\n  const message = res.data;\n  // message is a string\n} else {\n  // handle the error\n}\n```\n\nThe above code can be simplified by using the `handle` helper:\n\n```ts\nimport { handle } from \"oazapfts\";\n\nawait handle(api.getPetById(1), {\n  200(pet) {\n    // pet is properly typed as Pet\n  },\n  404(message) {\n    // message is as string\n  },\n});\n```\n\nThe helper will throw an `HttpError` error for any unhandled status code, unless you add a `default` handler:\n\n```ts\nawait handle(api.getPetById(1), {\n  200(pet) {\n    // ...\n  },\n  default(status, data) {\n    // handle error\n  },\n});\n```\n\n## Optimistic mode\n\nYou can opt into the _optimistic mode_ by using the `--optimistic` command line argument.\n\nIn this mode, each function will return a Promise for the happy path, i.e. the type specified for the first `2xx` response.\n\nLooking back at our Pet Store example from above, consuming the response is now much easier and less verbose:\n\n```ts\nconst pet = await api.getPetById(1);\n// pet is now typed as Pet!\n```\n\nIn case of a response other than `200` the promise will be rejected with a `HttpError`.\n\n## Mixing both modes\n\nSometimes you might want to use the optimistic mode for some of your API calls, but need the full `ApiResponse` for others.\n\nIn that case, you can use the `ok`-helper function to selectively apply optimistic response handling:\n\n```ts\nimport { ok } from \"oazapfts\";\n\nconst pet = await ok(api.getPetById(1));\n```\n\n## Overriding the defaults\n\nThe generated file exports a `defaults` constant that can be used to override the `basePath`, provide a custom `fetch` implementation or to send additional `headers` with each request. Basically, you can set a default for any [fetch option](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch#options) you want.\n\n```ts\nimport * as api from \"./api.ts\";\nimport nodeFetch from \"node-fetch\";\n\n// Override the spec's basePath\napi.defaults.basePath = \"https://example.com/api\";\n\n// Send this header with each request\napi.defaults.headers = {\n  access_token: \"secret\",\n};\n\n// Include credentials in CORS requests, too\napi.defaults.credentials = \"include\";\n\n// Use this instead of the global fetch\napi.defaults.fetch = nodeFetch;\n```\n\n## Alternatives and integrations\n\nIf this library doesn't fit your needs, take a look at [openapi-typescript-codegen](https://github.com/ferdikoomen/openapi-typescript-codegen) which follows a similar philosophy but creates many individual files instead of one single self-contained file.\n\nIf your frontend uses React, take a look at [react-api-query](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-api-query) which makes it easy to use an oazapfts client with React hooks in a convenient and type-safe way.\n\n## About the name\n\nThe name comes from a combination of syllables **oa** (OpenAPI) and **ts** (TypeScript) and is [pronounced \U0001F5E3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chvb-K95rBE) like the Bavarian _O'zapt'is!_ (it's tapped), the famous words that mark the beginning of the Oktoberfest.\n\n# License\n\nMIT\n"

  # Enrich your OpenAPI 3.0 schema with examples


  Thanks to the wonderful
  [swagger-snippet](https://github.com/ErikWittern/swagger-snippet) module you
  can now simply enrich your OpenAPI schema with code samples. It's as easy as
  1.2.3.


  1. ``npm install snippet-enricher-cli``

  2. ``./node_modules/.bin/snippet-enricher-cli --input=your_oas.json``


  ## Example Usage


  Enrich your OAS 3.0 Schema

  ```

  ./node_modules/.bin/snippet-enricher-cli --input=openapi.json >
  openapi-with-examples.json

  ```

  Alternatively you can point it to a YAML-formatted spec:

  ```

  curl
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/master/examples/v3.0/petstore.yaml
  --output petstore.yaml

  ./node_modules/.bin/snippet-enricher-cli --input=petstore.yaml >
  openapi-with-examples.json

  ```


  Use targets options to specific languages:

  ```

  ./node_modules/.bin/snippet-enricher-cli --targets="node_request,shell_curl"
  --input=openapi.json > openapi-with-examples.json

  ```


  Use [ReDoc](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc/) to build beautiful API doc:

  ```

  redoc-cli bundle openapi-with-examples.json

  ```


  enjoy.

  [日本語](./docs/ja/README-ja.md)


  This library provides TypeScript type definitions and extracted parameters
  from OpenAPI v3.0.x compliant specifications.

  TypeScript AST is used to generate the code, which is accurately converted to
  TypeScript code.

  Since the parameters extracted from OpenAPI can be used freely, it can be used
  for automatic generation of API Client and Server Side code, load balancer
  configuration files, etc.

  ## Usage


  The example shown here can be cloned from the [DEMO
  repository](https://github.com/Himenon/openapi-typescript-code-generator-demo-project)
  to see how it works.


  ### Generate typedef-only code


  ```ts

  import * as fs from "fs";


  import { CodeGenerator } from "@himenon/openapi-typescript-code-generator";


  const main = () => {
    const codeGenerator = new CodeGenerator("your/openapi/spec.yml");
    const code = codeGenerator.generateTypeDefinition();
    fs.writeFileSync("client.ts", code, { encoding: "utf-8" });
  };


  main();

  ```


  ### Generate code containing the API Client


  ```ts

  import * as fs from "fs";


  import { CodeGenerator } from "@himenon/openapi-typescript-code-generator";

  import * as Templates from
  "@himenon/openapi-typescript-code-generator/templates";

  import type * as Types from
  "@himenon/openapi-typescript-code-generator/types";


  const main = () => {
    const codeGenerator = new CodeGenerator("your/openapi/spec.yml");

    const apiClientGeneratorTemplate: Types.CodeGenerator.CustomGenerator<Templates.FunctionalApiClient.Option> = {
      generator: Templates.FunctionalApiClient.generator,
      option: {},
    };

    const code = codeGenerator.generateTypeDefinition([
      codeGenerator.getAdditionalTypeDefinitionCustomCodeGenerator(),
      apiClientGeneratorTemplate,
    ]);

    fs.writeFileSync("client.ts", code, { encoding: "utf-8" });
  };


  main();

  ```


  ### The variation of template code


  This library provides three types of templates


  ```ts

  import * as Templates from
  "@himenon/openapi-typescript-code-generator/templates";


  Templates.ClassApiClient.generator;

  Templates.FunctionalApiClient.generator;

  Templates.CurryingFunctionalApiClient.generator;

  ```


  #### `Templates.ClassApiClient.generator`


  We provide a class-based API client. Please inject the API client dependency
  and use it instead of `constructor`.


  ```ts

  export interface RequestArgs {
    httpMethod: HttpMethod;
    url: string;
    headers: ObjectLike | any;
    requestBody?: ObjectLike | any;
    requestBodyEncoding?: Record<string, Encoding>;
    queryParameters?: QueryParameters | undefined;
  }


  export interface ApiClient<RequestOption> {
    request: <T = SuccessResponses>(requestArgs: RequestArgs, options?: RequestOption) => Promise<T>;
  }


  export class Client<RequestOption> {
    private baseUrl: string;
    constructor(private apiClient: ApiClient<RequestOption>, baseUrl: string) {
      this.baseUrl = baseUrl.replace(/\/$/, "");
    }

    public async createPublisherV2<RequestContentType extends RequestContentType$createPublisherV2>(
      params: Params$createPublisherV2<RequestContentType>,
      option?: RequestOption,
    ): Promise<Response$createPublisherV2$Status$200["application/json"]> {
      const url = this.baseUrl + `/create/v2/publisher/{id}`;
      const headers = {
        "Content-Type": params.headers["Content-Type"],
        Accept: "application/json",
      };
      const requestEncodings = {
        "application/x-www-form-urlencoded": {
          color: {
            style: "form",
            explode: false,
          },
        },
        "application/json": {
          color: {
            style: "form",
            explode: false,
          },
        },
      };
      return this.apiClient.request(
        {
          httpMethod: "POST",
          url,
          headers,
          requestBody: params.requestBody,
          requestBodyEncoding: requestEncodings[params.headers["Content-Type"]],
        },
        option,
      );
    }
  }

  ```


  #### `Templates.FunctionalApiClient.generator`


  We also provide a function-based API client that replaces the class-based API
  client with `createClient`. Please inject the API client dependency and use
  it.


  ```ts

  export interface RequestArgs {
    httpMethod: HttpMethod;
    url: string;
    headers: ObjectLike | any;
    requestBody?: ObjectLike | any;
    requestBodyEncoding?: Record<string, Encoding>;
    queryParameters?: QueryParameters | undefined;
  }


  export interface ApiClient<RequestOption> {
    request: <T = SuccessResponses>(requestArgs: RequestArgs, options?: RequestOption) => Promise<T>;
  }


  export const createClient = <RequestOption>(apiClient:
  ApiClient<RequestOption>, baseUrl: string) => {
    const _baseUrl = baseUrl.replace(/\/$/, "");
    return {
      createPublisherV2: <RequestContentType extends RequestContentType$createPublisherV2>(
        params: Params$createPublisherV2<RequestContentType>,
        option?: RequestOption,
      ): Promise<Response$createPublisherV2$Status$200["application/json"]> => {
        const url = _baseUrl + `/create/v2/publisher/{id}`;
        const headers = {
          "Content-Type": params.headers["Content-Type"],
          Accept: "application/json",
        };
        const requestEncodings = {
          "application/x-www-form-urlencoded": {
            color: {
              style: "form",
              explode: false,
            },
          },
          "application/json": {
            color: {
              style: "form",
              explode: false,
            },
          },
        };
        return apiClient.request(
          {
            httpMethod: "POST",
            url,
            headers,
            requestBody: params.requestBody,
            requestBodyEncoding: requestEncodings[params.headers["Content-Type"]],
          },
          option,
        );
      },
    };
  };

  ```


  #### `Templates.CurryingFunctionalApiClient.generator`


  **Tree shaking support**


  We also provide a curried function-based API client that requires injection of
  API client for each `operationId`. The first function argument demands
  `ApiClient` while the second function argument demands `RequestArgs`. The
  `ApiClient` interface is different from the others, as it requires `uri` as an
  argument.


  This is designed for use cases that utilize **tree shaking**.


  ```ts

  export interface RequestArgs {
    httpMethod: HttpMethod;
    uri: string; // <------------------ Note that the uri
    headers: ObjectLike | any;
    requestBody?: ObjectLike | any;
    requestBodyEncoding?: Record<string, Encoding>;
    queryParameters?: QueryParameters | undefined;
  }

  export interface ApiClient<RequestOption> {
    request: <T = SuccessResponses>(requestArgs: RequestArgs, options?: RequestOption) => Promise<T>;
  }

  export const createPublisherV2 =
    <RequestOption>(apiClient: ApiClient<RequestOption>) =>
    <RequestContentType extends RequestContentType$createPublisherV2>(
      params: Params$createPublisherV2<RequestContentType>,
      option?: RequestOption,
    ): Promise<Response$createPublisherV2$Status$200["application/json"]> => {
      const uri = `/create/v2/publisher/{id}`;
      const headers = {
        "Content-Type": params.headers["Content-Type"],
        Accept: "application/json",
      };
      const requestEncodings = {
        "application/x-www-form-urlencoded": {
          color: {
            style: "form",
            explode: false,
          },
        },
        "application/json": {
          color: {
            style: "form",
            explode: false,
          },
        },
      };
      return apiClient.request(
        {
          httpMethod: "POST",
          uri,
          headers,
          requestBody: params.requestBody,
          requestBodyEncoding: requestEncodings[params.headers["Content-Type"]],
        },
        option,
      );
    };
  ```


  ### Split the type definition file and the API Client implementation


  ```ts

  import * as fs from "fs";


  import { CodeGenerator } from "@himenon/openapi-typescript-code-generator";

  import * as Templates from
  "@himenon/openapi-typescript-code-generator/templates";

  import type * as Types from
  "@himenon/openapi-typescript-code-generator/types";


  const main = () => {
    const codeGenerator = new CodeGenerator("your/openapi/spec.yml");

    const apiClientGeneratorTemplate: Types.CodeGenerator.CustomGenerator<Templates.FunctionalApiClient.Option> = {
      generator: Templates.FunctionalApiClient.generator,
      option: {},
    };

    const typeDefCode = codeGenerator.generateTypeDefinition();
    const apiClientCode = codeGenerator.generateCode([
      {
        generator: () => {
          return [`import { Schemas, Responses } from "./types";`];
        },
      },
      codeGenerator.getAdditionalTypeDefinitionCustomCodeGenerator(),
      apiClientGeneratorTemplate,
    ]);

    fs.writeFileSync("types.ts", typeDefCode, { encoding: "utf-8" });
    fs.writeFileSync("apiClient.ts", apiClientCode, { encoding: "utf-8" });
  };


  main();

  ```


  ## Create a Code Template


  The examples in this section can be used in the following ways


  ```ts

  import * as fs from "fs";


  import { CodeGenerator } from "@himenon/openapi-typescript-code-generator";

  import type * as Types from
  "@himenon/openapi-typescript-code-generator/types";


  /** Write the definition of the Code Template here. */

  const customGenerator: Types.CodeGenerator.CustomGenerator<{}> = {
    /** .... */
  };


  const codeGenerator = new CodeGenerator("your/openapi/spec.yml");


  const code = codeGenerator.generateCode([customGenerator]);


  fs.writeFileSync("output/file/name", code, { encoding: "utf-8" });

  ```


  ### Define a text-based code template


  A self-defined code generator can return an array of `string`.


  ```ts

  import * as Types from "@himenon/openapi-typescript-code-generator/types";


  interface Option {
    showLog?: boolean;
  }


  const generator: Types.CodeGenerator.GenerateFunction<Option> = (payload:
  Types.CodeGenerator.Params[], option): string[] => {
    if (option && option.showLog) {
      console.log("show log message");
    }
    return ["Hello world"];
  };


  const customGenerator: Types.CodeGenerator.CustomGenerator<Option> = {
    generator: generator,
    option: {},
  };

  ```


  ### Define using the information extracted from OpenAPI Schema


  The self-defined code generator can accept parameters extracted from OpenAPI
  Schema.

  See Type definitions for available parameters.


  ```ts

  import * as Types from "@himenon/openapi-typescript-code-generator/types";


  interface Option {}


  const generator: Types.CodeGenerator.GenerateFunction<Option> = (payload:
  Types.CodeGenerator.Params[], option): string[] => {
    return payload.map(params => {
      return `function ${params.operationId}() { console.log("${params.comment}") }`;
    });
  };


  const customGenerator: Types.CodeGenerator.CustomGenerator<Option> = {
    generator: generator,
    option: {},
  };

  ```


  ### Define any Data Types Format


  Convert a Data Type with the following `format` to any type definition.


  ```yaml

  components:
    schemas:
      Binary:
        type: string
        format: binary
      IntOrString:
        type: string
        format: int-or-string
      AandB:
        type: string
        format: A-and-B
  ```


  The option to convert the Data Type Format to an arbitrary type definition is
  defined as follows.


  ```ts

  import { CodeGenerator, Option } from
  "@himenon/openapi-typescript-code-generator";

  const option: Option = {
    convertOption: {
      formatConversions: [
        {
          selector: {
            format: "binary",
          },
          output: {
            type: ["Blob"],
          },
        },
        {
          selector: {
            format: "int-or-string",
          },
          output: {
            type: ["number", "string"],
          },
        },
        {
          selector: {
            format: "A-and-B",
          },
          output: {
            type: ["A", "B"],
            multiType: "allOf",
          },
        },
      ],
    },
  };

  const codeGenerator = new CodeGenerator(inputFilename, option);

  ```


  The typedef generated by this will look like this


  ```ts

  export namespace Schemas {
    export type Binary = Blob;
    export type IntOrString = number | string;
    export type AandB = A & B;
  }

  ```


  ### Define a code template with TypeScript AST


  You can extend your code using the API of TypeScript AST.

  You can directly use the API of TypeScript AST or use the wrapper API of
  TypeScript AST provided by this library.


  ```ts

  import * as Types from "@himenon/openapi-typescript-code-generator/types";

  import { TsGenerator } from "@himenon/openapi-typescript-code-generator/api";


  interface Option {}


  const factory = TsGenerator.Factory.create();


  const generator: Types.CodeGenerator.GenerateFunction<Option> = (
    payload: Types.CodeGenerator.Params[],
    option,
  ): Types.CodeGenerator.IntermediateCode[] => {
    return payload.map(params => {
      return factory.InterfaceDeclaration.create({
        export: true,
        name: params.functionName,
        members: [],
      });
    });
  };


  const customGenerator: Types.CodeGenerator.CustomGenerator<Option> = {
    generator: generator,
    option: {},
  };

  ```


  ## API


  ### CodeGenerator


  ```ts

  import { CodeGenerator } from "@himenon/openapi-typescript-code-generator";

  ```


  #### validateOpenApiSchema


  Performs validation of the input OpenAPI Schema.


  #### generateTypeDefinition


  Generates code that converts OpenAPI Schema to TypeScript type definitions.


  #### generateCode


  You can specify several of your own code generators, and the generators can
  use parameters extracted from OpenAPI Schema.

  It internally performs the conversion of an array of `string` or
  `ts.Statement` as a string.


  For example, creating a generator in units of file divisions increases the
  reusability of the generator.


  #### getCodeGeneratorParamsArray


  It provides parameters extracted from OpenAPI Schema.


  #### getAdditionalTypeDefinitionCustomCodeGenerator


  This is a type definition file for `Templates.FunctionalApiClient`. The reason
  it is not included in `generateTypeDefinition` is that you may not use the
  type definition generated by this function depending on your usage.


  ※ The reason it is not included in `generateTypeDefinition` is that you may
  not use the type definitions generated by this function depending on your
  application.


  ### TsGenerator


  ```ts

  import { TsGenerator } from "@himenon/openapi-typescript-code-generator/api";

  ```


  This is a wrapper API for the TypeScript AST used internally.

  It is subject to change without notice.


  ### OpenApiTools


  ```ts

  import { OpenApiTools } from "@himenon/openapi-typescript-code-generator/api";

  ```


  #### Parser


  - `OpenApiTools.Parser`


  This is the API for parsing OpenAPI Schema.

  It is subject to change without notice.


  ## Restrictions


  ### Directory Restrictions for Remote Reference


  There is a limitation on the directory structure supported.

  To simplify implementation when converting directory structures to TypeScript
  namespaces, Remote References using `$ref` should only be defined in the
  following directory structures.

  If you want to extend it, please fork this repository and do it yourself.


  ```

  spec.yml // entry file

  components/
    headers/
    parameters/
    pathItems/
    requestBodies/
    responses/
    schemas/
    paths/
  ```


  ### HTTP communication restrictions for Remote Reference


  `$ref: http://....` Currently not supported. We hope to support it in the
  future.


  ## Contributions


  First of all, thank you for your interest.

  When converting from the API specification to TypeScript code, resolving
  reference relationships can be particularly challenging, and there may not be
  enough test cases.

  Adding test cases is a very powerful support for stabilizing the behavior, so
  please report any bugs you find that are behaving strangely.

  Also, the basic design concepts of this repository can be found below. If you
  want to make changes that do not follow these concepts, please fork and extend
  them.

  If your changes are in line with the design concept, please submit a pull
  request or issue!


  ## Design Concept


  - Be typedef first.

  - Typedefs should not contain any entities (file size should be 0 when
  typedefs are converted to `.js`)

  - The directory structure should be mapped to the typedef structure.

  - No dependency on any API client library.

  - Can be extended by TypeScript AST.

  - Conform to the OpenAPI specification.

  - It should be a single file to maintain portability.


  ## Development


  ```bash

  git clone https://github.com/Himenon/openapi-typescript-code-generator.git

  cd openapi-typescript-code-generator

  pnpm i

  #### your change

  pnpm build

  pnpm run test:code:gen

  pnpm run update:snapshot # if you changed

  pnpm run test

  ```

  [![GoDoc](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/GeniusesGroup/libgo)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/GeniusesGroup/libgo)

  [![Go
  Report](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/GeniusesGroup/libgo)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/GeniusesGroup/libgo)


  An **application** developing **framework** provide ZeroOps(zero operations),
  edge computing, ... that let you develope both server and client applications
  in Go without need to think more about any fundamental requirements, Just
  develope business services and user interfaces (now just graphical interface -
  gui), build apps as OS images or OS applications and easily just run first
  server node and let it distributes by many factors with inside logics not need
  external decision makers (automating software deployment) like
  Kubernetes(K8s).


  In other word, `libgo` abbreviation of `Go language library` is a repository
  wrapper to store all implementation of GeniusesGroup and others protocols and
  algorithms to make a digital software more easily in better performance.

  You can use all packages exported APIs, go generator mechanism or by [library
  commands](#commands-cla) to access some useful APIs from command line easily.


  ## Goals

  - Provide complete framework to develope any purpose distributed application
  with **low||no code**.

  - No(minimum) dependency on any other repositories.

  - Compile an application as **Unikernel** instead of regular OSs binaries.

  - Develope high available and distributed software without any admin in any
  infrastructure layers (DevOps culture goal).

  - Let service developers act Lean and Agile in their organization.

  - [Reinvent the wheel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinventing_the_wheel)


  ## Not Goals

  - 


  ## Installation

  - Make project directory and suggest use your internet domain name for it.

  - initialize project version control. If you use git run `git init` or `git
  clone ${repository path}`.

  - init go project by `go mod init`

  - add `libgo` to your project dependency

  - install `libgo` with `lang_eng` or your desire language

  - initialize the project with desire domain e.g. `google.com`

  - Complete manifest in main package.

  - Add other data to main package if needed.

  - Implement protocols logic by autogenerate some codes not write them
  manually.

  - build your organization app with desire tags and target OS and hardwares.

  - run your desire version from /bin/ directory. Strongly suggest run app by
  systemd on linux or other app manager on other OS.


  or easily run the following command under your project, just replace your
  domain name.

  ```

  mkdir {domain}

  git init

  go mod init

  go get -u github.com/GeniusesGroup/libgo

  go install github.com/GeniusesGroup/libgo -tags "lang_eng"

  libgo app init -d={domain}

  libgo app build

  ```


  ## Commands (CLA)

  libgo has a the command-line client for the some generator APIs implement in
  [modules](./modules/). It provides simple access to all APIs functions to make
  an application, a GUI app, ....


  You can get list of all commands and their helps with `libgo help`. We just
  list some of important commands here that you can run them from within a Go
  module or any where in your project directory:

  - **Initialize a project:** `libgo app init -idn=[internet-domain-name]`

  - **Add new domain module:** `libgo mod new -dn=[domain-name]`

  - **Build the apps(os images):** `libgo app build`

  - **Run the app(os image):** `libgo app run`


  ## Build tags
